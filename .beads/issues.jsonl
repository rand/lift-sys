Enable tool call parser and expert parallelism\n\n**Testing**:\n- Compare latency against vLLM (expect 3-10x faster)\n- Verify XGrammar schema compliance\n- Measure throughput improvement\n- Calculate cost per request vs vLLM\n\n**When to Do This**:\n- If request volume justifies optimization effort\n- If latency becomes critical (\u003e 5s not acceptable)\n- After establishing that quality is sufficient with current model\n\n**Decision Criteria**:\n- Performance improvement \u003e= 3x\n- Same quality as vLLM\n- Deployment complexity acceptable\n- Cost per request significantly lower despite same GPU\n\n**Documentation**: docs/QWEN3_CODER_GUIDE.md, docs/SGLANG_MODAL_ISSUES.md","acceptance_criteria":"SGLang deployment working with 3x+ faster generation vs vLLM while maintaining quality","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-14T22:42:48.729308-06:00","updated_at":"2025-10-14T22:42:48.729308-06:00"}
