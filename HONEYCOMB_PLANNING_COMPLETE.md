## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- **OpenTelemetry maturity**: Widely adopted, battle-tested SDK
- **Honeycomb free tier**: 20M events/month sufficient for development
- **Performance overhead**: <1% typical, negligible vs LLM latency
- **Deployment simplicity**: Modal secrets + dependency install

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **Learning curve**: Team unfamiliar with Honeycomb UI
  - **Mitigation**: 1-hour training session, comprehensive docs
- **Alert fatigue**: Too many false positives
  - **Mitigation**: Start with conservative thresholds, adjust based on data
- **Event volume growth**: Approaching free tier limit
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor usage weekly, implement sampling if needed

### Negligible Risk ✅
- **Production incidents**: Instrumentation isolated, can disable quickly
- **Cost overruns**: Free tier + sampling keeps costs at $0
- **Integration complexity**: Auto-instrumentation handles most work

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate** (this week):
1. Engineering lead assigns tasks to team

- Verify traces flowing to Honeycomb
- Review dashboards daily

**Week 2**:
- Complete Phases 4-6 (dashboards + alerts + validation)
- Conduct team training
- Run acceptance tests

- Analyze slow queries
- Refine alert thresholds
- Document lessons learned

## Related Work

### Parallel Workstreams

**Supabase Integration** (lift-sys-259 through 264):
- Database persistence for sessions
- Complements Honeycomb (SQLAlchemy auto-instrumentation)
- Can proceed in parallel or sequence

**Infrastructure Planning**:
- INFRASTRUCTURE_RESEARCH_REPORT.md (completed)
- Recommendation: Modal + Supabase (defer multi-cloud)
- Honeycomb aligns with this strategy

### Future Enhancements

**Post-Integration Optimizations**:
- Tail-based sampling (if event volume exceeds budget)
- Custom instrumentation for business events
- Honeycomb Refinery deployment (for advanced sampling)
- Integration with incident management tools (PagerDuty, OpsGenie)

**Additional Monitoring**:
- Frontend observability (if building web UI)
- Mobile app tracing (if building mobile app)
- Synthetic monitoring (Pingdom, Datadog)
