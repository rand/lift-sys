## Key Modifications from FSL-1.1-MIT

This variant modifies the standard FSL-1.1-MIT license in two ways:

1. **Extended timeframe**: Changes the conversion period from 2 years to **4 years**
2. **Tagged releases only**: Restricts the license applicability to **publicly available tagged releases** only

This means that:
- Only software versions that are published as tagged releases (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.3.1) are covered
- Intermediate commits, development branches, and unreleased code are not covered by this license
- Each tagged release becomes MIT-licensed 4 years after its release date
- The date of availability is determined by when the tagged release is publicly made available
