## Cost Analysis

### Development/Testing Costs

**Phase 3 baseline test** (18 tests):
- Total GPU time: ~10 minutes (including cold start)
- GPU cost: $4/hr × (10/60) = $0.67
- Per-test cost: $0.67 / 18 = $0.037
- **Total estimated cost**: ~$0.11 (IR + code generation)

**Phase 3 Best-of-N test** (18 tests × 3 candidates):
- Total GPU time: ~20-30 minutes
- GPU cost: $4/hr × (30/60) = $2.00
- Per-test cost: $2.00 / 18 = $0.11
- **Total estimated cost**: ~$0.33 (IR + code generation)

### Production Costs (Projected)

**Assumptions**:
- Average IR generation: 5 seconds
- scaledown_window: 600 seconds (10 minutes)

**Scenario 1**: Low traffic (<6 requests/hour)
- Pay for idle time: $4/hr
- Cost per IR: $4/hr × (5s/3600s) = $0.0056 + idle overhead

**Scenario 2**: High traffic (≥6 requests/hour)
- Amortized idle time negligible
- Cost per IR: ~$0.0056
- With Best-of-N (N=3): ~$0.017 per IR

**Comparison**:
- Qwen2.5-32B baseline: $0.006/IR, 77.8% quality
- Qwen2.5-32B + Best-of-N: $0.017/IR, TBD quality (testing)
- Claude 3.5 API: ~$0.015/IR, 95%+ quality (estimate)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (In Progress)

1. ✅ Deploy Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct to Modal
2. ✅ Test endpoint responds
3. ✅ Deploy optimized Modal config with increased timeout
4. ✅ Run Phase 3 baseline with Qwen2.5-32B (77.8% success)
5. ⏳ **Run Phase 3 with Best-of-N (N=3)** - testing now

### After Best-of-N Results

**If Best-of-N ≥80%**:
- ✅ Goal achieved! Document findings
- Test on more complex scenarios
- Consider production deployment

**If Best-of-N <80%**:
- Option 1: Escalate to Claude 3.5 for IR generation (expected 85-95%)
- Option 2: Fine-tune Qwen2.5-32B on IR generation examples
- Option 3: Improve quality scoring rubric for Best-of-N
- Option 4: Hybrid approach (Claude 3.5 for hard cases, Qwen2.5-32B for easy ones)

## Key Learnings

### What Worked

1. **Model family matters**: Qwen2.5 series works well with current IR schema, Qwen3 does not
2. **Model size helps**: 32B significantly better than 7B (+5.6%)
3. **Volume caching**: Reduces cold start from 8 minutes to 53 seconds (after first download)
4. **Timeout tuning**: Critical for large models (1200s timeout needed for first load)
5. **XGrammar constraints**: Ensures valid JSON every time

### What Didn't Work

1. **Qwen3-Coder-30B-FP8**: Incompatible with current prompts/schema (16.7% success)
2. **Default timeouts**: Too short for 32B model cold starts
3. **Generic quality scoring**: May not correlate with actual correctness

### Surprising Findings

1. **Function name mismatches**: Auto-resolution works well (7/14 passing tests had name mismatches)
2. **AST repairs**: Effective at fixing minor syntax issues (3 tests)
3. **String manipulation**: Surprisingly weak category (33.3% success rate)
4. **Assertion validation**: Warnings don't always mean failure (2 tests passed despite warnings)

## Technical Details

### Cold Start Timeline (Third Attempt - Cached)

```
19:54:42  Start container
19:54:53  Model config loaded (11s)
19:55:13  Model initialization started (20s)
19:56:07  Model weights loaded from volume (53s) ✅ CACHED
19:56:08  Model loaded into VRAM (61.04 GiB)
19:57:22  torch.compile completed (72s)
19:58:51  CUDA graph capture completed (41s)
19:59:33  Model ready for inference
Total: ~300 seconds (~5 minutes)
```

**First attempt** (uncached): ~483 seconds download + compile = 8+ minutes
**Second attempt**: Worker preemption during torch.compile (timeout)
**Third attempt**: Success with cached model

### Memory Breakdown

```
Model weights: 61.04 GiB
KV cache: 8.57 GiB available
GPU total: 80 GiB A100

## Conclusion

**Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct is a significant upgrade over Qwen2.5-7B**, achieving **77.8% success rate** on Phase 3 tests (vs 72.2% for 7B). The model is stable, cost-effective for development, and ready for production use.

**Best-of-N testing is in progress** to determine if we can reach the 80%+ success rate goal. Results expected in 15-20 minutes.

**Alternative path**: If Best-of-N doesn't reach 80%, Claude 3.5 API integration is ready as a fallback, offering 85-95% expected quality at comparable cost ($0.015/IR vs $0.017/IR for Best-of-N).
