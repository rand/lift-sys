# Supabase Connection Issue: DNS Resolution Failure

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Issue**: Cannot connect to Supabase database - DNS hostname not resolving
**Status**: BLOCKED - Waiting for Supabase project provisioning to complete

---

## Problem Summary

Your Supabase project was created, but the database hostname is not resolving via DNS:

```
Hostname: db.bqokcxjusdkywfgfqhzo.supabase.co
Error: could not translate host name to address
```

### DNS Diagnostics Results

```bash
$ dig db.bqokcxjusdkywfgfqhzo.supabase.co
# Result: No A record found (NOERROR but ANSWER: 0)

$ nslookup db.bqokcxjusdkywfgfqhzo.supabase.co
# Result: "No answer"

$ ping db.bqokcxjusdkywfgfqhzo.supabase.co
# Result: "cannot resolve... Unknown host"
```

**Interpretation**: The Supabase DNS zone exists (`supabase.co`), but there's no DNS record for your specific database hostname yet.

---

## Root Cause

**Most Likely**: Your Supabase project is still being provisioned. When you create a new project via the Supabase web UI:

1. Project is created immediately (you can see it in dashboard)
2. Backend infrastructure is provisioned (PostgreSQL cluster, networking, DNS)
3. DNS records are created and propagated

**Step 2-3 can take 5-30 minutes** (sometimes longer during high load).

---

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Verify Project Status (DO THIS FIRST)

Go to Supabase Dashboard and check your project status:

```
1. Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click on your "lift-sys" project (or whatever you named it)
3. Look at the top of the page for status indicator

Expected states:
✅ "Active" or "Healthy" → Project ready (DNS should resolve soon)
⏳ "Setting up" or "Provisioning" → Still initializing (wait)
❌ "Error" or "Failed" → Contact Supabase support
```

### 2. Get Correct Connection String from UI

**DO NOT trust the connection string from earlier instructions.** Get it directly from the dashboard:

```
1. In your Supabase project, go to: Settings → Database
2. Scroll to "Connection string" section
3. You'll see TWO tabs:
   - "Connection Pooling" (port 6543) - RECOMMENDED
   - "Direct connection" (port 5432)

4. Click "Connection Pooling" tab
5. Select "URI" mode (not "PSQL" or "JDBC")
6. Copy the full connection string

It should look like:
postgresql://postgres.PROJECT_REF:PASSWORD@aws-0-REGION.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

NOTE: The hostname format may be DIFFERENT from what we tried:
- Pooler: aws-0-REGION.pooler.supabase.com (not db.PROJECT_REF.supabase.co)
- Region might be us-east-1, us-west-1, eu-west-1, etc.
```

### 3. Test Connection with Correct String

Once you have the correct connection string from step 2:

```bash
# Replace [YOUR-PASSWORD] with: sgVOFNCgIWk585q8
export DATABASE_URL="<paste connection string here with password>"

# Test connection
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT version();"

# If psql not available, use Python:
python3 -c "
import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect('$DATABASE_URL')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT version();')
print(cursor.fetchone()[0])
conn.close()
"
```

### 4. Update run_migrations.py with Correct URL

Once you have a working connection string, update `run_migrations.py`:

```python
# Line 20 - Replace with your actual working connection string
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://postgres.PROJECT_REF:sgVOFNCgIWk585q8@aws-0-REGION.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
```

## Alternative: Connection Pooler vs Direct Connection

Supabase provides TWO ways to connect:

### Option A: Connection Pooler (Port 6543) - RECOMMENDED

```
Host format: aws-0-REGION.pooler.supabase.com
Port: 6543
Mode: Transaction pooling
Pros: Better for serverless, handles many connections
Cons: Some PostgreSQL features not available (LISTEN/NOTIFY, etc.)
```

### Option B: Direct Connection (Port 5432)

```
Host format: db.PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
Port: 5432
Mode: Direct PostgreSQL
Pros: Full PostgreSQL feature set
Cons: Limited connection slots (can exhaust under load)
```

**Current issue**: The direct connection hostname (`db.bqokcxjusdkywfgfqhzo.supabase.co`) is not resolving.

**Try pooler instead**: Get connection pooler URL from dashboard and use that.

## Timeline Expectations

- **0-5 minutes**: Project shows "Provisioning" in dashboard
- **5-15 minutes**: Project shows "Active", DNS may still be propagating
- **15-30 minutes**: DNS should be fully propagated globally
- **30+ minutes**: If still not working, contact Supabase support

## What's Already Complete

While we wait for DNS to resolve, here's what's ready to go:

1. ✅ All 7 migration SQL files created (`migrations/001-007_*.sql`)
2. ✅ Python migration runner (`run_migrations.py`)
3. ✅ Bash migration runner (`migrations/run_all_migrations.sh`)
4. ✅ Complete schema documentation (`docs/SUPABASE_SCHEMA.md`)
5. ✅ Setup instructions (`docs/SUPABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
6. ✅ Troubleshooting guide (`docs/SUPABASE_CONNECTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)

**All files are ready.** Once DNS resolves, we can run migrations immediately.

---

## Next Steps (After Connection Works)

1. Run migrations: `uv run python run_migrations.py`
2. Verify schema in Supabase Studio (Table Editor)
3. Configure Modal secrets for production access
4. Implement SupabaseSessionStore class (lift-sys-261)
5. Integrate with API layer (lift-sys-262)

---

## If Problem Persists Beyond 30 Minutes

1. **Check Supabase Status Page**: https://status.supabase.com
   - Look for any ongoing incidents or outages

2. **Verify Project Billing/Limits**:
   - Ensure free tier limits not exceeded
   - Check no payment issues (if on paid plan)

3. **Try Creating Test Project**:
   - Create a new project in same region
   - See if DNS resolves for test project
   - If test works but lift-sys doesn't → Something wrong with lift-sys project

4. **Contact Supabase Support**:
   - Dashboard → Support → New ticket
   - Mention: "DNS not resolving for database hostname after 30+ minutes"
   - Provide project reference ID: `bqokcxjusdkywfgfqhzo`

---

## Current Recommendation

**WAIT 15-30 minutes**, then:

1. Refresh Supabase dashboard - check project status
2. Get connection string from dashboard (both pooler and direct)
3. Try both connection methods
4. Once one works, update `run_migrations.py` and proceed

**I'll help you run migrations as soon as you confirm connection is working.**

---

## Files Ready for Review

While waiting for DNS, you can review the schema design:

- **Database schema**: `docs/SUPABASE_SCHEMA.md` (800+ lines)
- **Migration files**: `migrations/00*.sql` (7 files)
- **Setup guide**: `docs/SUPABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

Let me know once you can connect, and we'll proceed immediately with migrations.
