# SWE-smith Evaluation for lift-sys
**Analysis Date**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: üìä Analysis Complete - Recommendation Provided
**Repository**: https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **SELECTIVELY VALUABLE** - Methodologies are highly relevant, but direct integration faces significant technical barriers.

**Key Takeaway**: SWE-smith's synthetic data generation and model fine-tuning methodologies align well with lift-sys's current challenges (80-90% success plateau), but the toolkit itself targets repository-level tasks rather than specification-to-code generation.

**Recommendation**: **Adopt methodologies, not infrastructure** - Implement SWE-smith-inspired approaches within lift-sys rather than integrating the toolkit directly.

4. Generating contextual issue descriptions
5. Training models on the resulting dataset

### Key Results
- **52,000 task instances** across 250+ repositories
- **26,000 agent trajectories** (agent behavior traces)
- Fine-tuned **Qwen 2.5 Coder ‚Üí SWE-agent-LM-32B**
- Achieved **+32% improvement** on SWE-bench Verified
- **40.2% pass@1** on SWE-bench Verified benchmark

### Technical Architecture
- **Docker-based** execution environments (one per repository)
- **Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS** required (no Windows/macOS support)
- **Programmatic task generation** from repository code
- **Unit test filtering** to ensure valid task instances
- **Integration with RL frameworks** (SkyRL mentioned)

## Relevance to lift-sys

### Current lift-sys Challenges

From recent session summaries and documentation:

1. **Success Rate Plateau** (PHASE_5A_FINAL_SESSION_SUMMARY.md)
   - Phase 2: 90% success (9/10 tests)
   - Phase 3: 80% baseline, 22% with Qwen3-30B-FP8 (regression)
   - Stuck at "last 10%" problem - diminishing returns

2. **IR Quality Issues** (QWEN3_PHASE3_ANALYSIS.md)
   - Missing return statements
   - Incomplete control flow
   - Semantic bugs that XGrammar can't prevent
   - LLM instruction following problems

3. **Limited Training Data**
   - Small test set (10-18 tests per phase)

## Detailed Analysis: Applicability to lift-sys

### 1. Synthetic Training Data Generation ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What SWE-smith Does:**
- Programmatically generates task instances from real code
- Creates 52k examples with validation
- Ensures tasks break tests (quality filter)

**How lift-sys Could Adapt:**

```python
# Inspired by SWE-smith, create IR-specific synthetic data
class LiftSysDataGenerator:
    """Generate synthetic training pairs for IR generation."""

    def generate_from_github_repos(self, repo_urls: list[str]) -> list[TrainingExample]:
        """Extract functions from repos and create NLP ‚Üí IR ‚Üí Code triples."""
        training_data = []

        for repo_url in repo_urls:
            # 1. Clone and analyze repository
            functions = self.extract_functions(repo_url)

            # 2. For each function, generate synthetic prompt
            for func in functions:
                # Generate prompt using reverse mode
                prompt = self.synthesize_prompt(func)

                # Generate IR using lift-sys reverse mode
                ir = self.lift_to_ir(func)

                # Validate the triple
                if self.validate_triple(prompt, ir, func):
                    training_data.append({
                        "prompt": prompt,
                        "ir": ir,
                        "code": func.source,
                        "test_cases": func.tests,
                    })

        return training_data
```

**Advantages:**
- Scale from 10-18 test cases to thousands
- Real-world code patterns from GitHub
- Automatic validation through existing tests
- Can target specific problem areas (control flow, edge cases)

**Implementation Path:**
1. Use lift-sys **reverse mode** to extract IRs from GitHub repos
2. Synthesize natural language prompts from IR + docstrings
3. Create (prompt, IR, code, tests) quadruples
4. Filter by quality (IR must round-trip correctly)
5. Fine-tune Qwen3 on this dataset

**Effort Estimate**: 1-2 weeks for MVP
**Expected Impact**: Could break through 90% plateau by specializing model

### 2. Task Instance Generation ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What SWE-smith Does:**
- Synthesizes task variations systematically
- Ensures task validity through test execution
- Generates diverse problem instances

**How lift-sys Could Adapt:**

```python
# Task instance generation for lift-sys test suite
class TaskInstanceGenerator:
    """Generate test cases programmatically like SWE-smith."""

    def generate_variants(self, base_test: TestCase) -> list[TestCase]:
        """Create variants of a test case by modifying parameters."""
        variants = []

        # Vary input types
        for input_type in ["int", "str", "list", "dict", "None"]:
            variants.append(self.vary_input_type(base_test, input_type))

        # Vary edge cases
        for edge in ["empty", "negative", "large", "special_chars"]:
            variants.append(self.vary_edge_case(base_test, edge))

        # Vary control flow complexity
        for branches in [2, 3, 5]:
            variants.append(self.vary_branches(base_test, branches))

        return variants
```

**Current Issue**: lift-sys has only 10-18 tests per phase
**SWE-smith Approach**: Generate hundreds of variants programmatically

**Advantages:**
- Much larger test coverage
- Systematic edge case exploration
- Automated test case generation
- Better validation of improvements

**Implementation Path:**
1. Create template-based test generator (similar to FINE_TUNING_SYNTHETIC_DATA_PLAN.md approach)
2. Generate 300-500 test cases automatically
3. Validate each with execution
4. Categorize by difficulty and patterns
5. Use for both evaluation and training

**Effort Estimate**: 3-5 days
**Expected Impact**: Better measurement of true success rate

### 3. Model Fine-Tuning Methodology ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What SWE-smith Achieved:**
- Qwen 2.5 Coder (base) ‚Üí SWE-agent-LM-32B (fine-tuned)
- +32% improvement on SWE-bench Verified
- 52k training instances

**How lift-sys Could Apply:**

**Current Plan** (from FINE_TUNING_SYNTHETIC_DATA_PLAN.md):
- Generate 300-500 examples with Claude/GPT-4
- Manual review and correction
- LoRA fine-tune Qwen3-30B

**SWE-smith Enhancement:**
- Scale to 5,000-10,000 examples using GitHub data
- Automated validation instead of manual review
- Use SWE-smith's filtering approach (must pass tests)

**Combined Approach:**
```
Phase 1: Generate 5k-10k (prompt, IR, code) triples from GitHub
Phase 2: Filter through execution (keep only working examples)
Phase 3: Quality score each example (keep top 50%)
Phase 4: LoRA fine-tune Qwen3-30B on filtered dataset
Phase 5: Evaluate on held-out test set
```

**Advantages over Current Plan:**
- 10-20x more training data (5k vs 300-500)
- Automated instead of manual review
- Real-world code patterns
- Proven methodology (+32% improvement)

**Challenges:**
- Requires reverse mode to work well (extracting IRs from code)
- Need GitHub API access and storage
- Training compute (but Modal can handle this)

**Effort Estimate**: 2-3 weeks
**Expected Impact**: 90% ‚Üí 95%+ success rate (based on SWE-smith's +32%)

### 4. Test Filtering and Validation ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What SWE-smith Does:**
- Keeps only tasks that "break 1+ unit tests"
- Ensures task instances are meaningful
- Validates through execution

**How lift-sys Could Apply:**

Currently (from PHASE_5A_FINAL_SESSION_SUMMARY.md):
- Assertion-based validation detects bugs
- Retries with feedback (not very effective)
- Manual analysis of failures

**SWE-smith-Inspired Improvement:**
```python
class ExecutionBasedFilter:
    """Filter training examples like SWE-smith filters tasks."""

    def filter_training_example(self, example: TrainingExample) -> bool:
        """Keep example only if it demonstrates correct behavior."""

        # Generate code from IR
        code = self.generate_code(example.ir)

        # Execute against test cases
        results = self.execute_tests(code, example.test_cases)

        # Keep if:
        # 1. Code compiles
        # 2. All test cases pass
        # 3. No semantic errors detected
        return (
            results.compiled and
            results.all_tests_passed and
            not results.semantic_errors
        )
```

**Advantages:**
- Ensures training data quality
- Automated filtering (scalable)
- Same validation as SWE-smith

**Effort Estimate**: 2-3 days (mostly integrating existing validation)
**Expected Impact**: Higher quality training data ‚Üí better fine-tuned model

### 5. Agent Trajectory Analysis ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What SWE-smith Provides:**
- 26k agent trajectories (state, action, result sequences)
- Shows how agents solve problems over multiple steps
- Could inform multi-step reasoning

**How lift-sys Could Apply:**

Currently:
- Multi-shot generation (3-5 attempts)
- Temperature variation
- Feedback loop (not very effective per PHASE_5A)

**Trajectory-Informed Improvement:**
- Analyze successful retry patterns
- Learn which feedback leads to fixes
- Model multi-step reasoning explicitly

**Challenge**: SWE-smith trajectories are for repository-level tasks, not IR generation
**Opportunity**: Collect lift-sys's own trajectories and analyze patterns

**Implementation Path:**
1. Log all retry attempts with context (current IR, feedback, next attempt)
2. Analyze which feedback patterns lead to successful fixes
3. Train a "feedback generator" model on successful patterns
4. Use learned feedback patterns instead of current heuristic feedback

**Effort Estimate**: 1-2 weeks
**Expected Impact**: More effective retries (currently limited effectiveness)

### 6. Docker-Based Infrastructure ‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What SWE-smith Does:**
- One Docker image per repository
- Isolated execution environments
- Reproducible builds

**Relevance to lift-sys:**
- lift-sys already uses Modal for inference (isolated environments)
- Docker would help for:
  - Testing against real repositories
  - Reverse mode analysis of arbitrary code
  - Reproducible benchmarking

**Challenge**: SWE-smith requires **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** (Linux only)
**Current Environment**: macOS (local development)

**Verdict**: Nice-to-have but not essential. Modal already provides isolation.

**Effort Estimate**: 1 week
**Expected Impact**: Better reproducibility, but low priority

   - lift-sys: Function-level specifications
   - Solution: Adapt task generation to function level

3. **Execution Model**
   - SWE-smith: Docker containers per repo
   - lift-sys: Modal serverless functions
   - Solution: Keep Modal, use SWE-smith ideas for test generation

4. **Validation Approach**
   - SWE-smith: Existing unit tests
   - lift-sys: Generated test cases from IR
   - Solution: Generate tests programmatically (current approach is good)

### Next Steps

**If approved**:
1. Review this analysis with team/stakeholders
2. Prioritize Tier 1 recommendations
3. Start with Phase 1: Data Generation (Week 1-2)
4. Validate approach with small-scale experiment (500 examples)
5. Scale up if results are promising

**If not approved**:
- Continue with current plans (CoT, Best-of-N, constraint propagation)
- Revisit SWE-smith approach if plateau persists

---

**Analysis Complete** ‚úÖ

**Key Insight**: SWE-smith's value is in its **methodology for creating specialized software engineering models**, not its specific task structure. By adapting these methodologies to lift-sys's specification-to-code generation problem, we can break through the 80-90% success plateau with proven techniques.

**Critical Success Factor**: Quality of reverse mode IR extraction will determine training data quality. If reverse mode works well, SWE-smith approach is highly promising. If not, may need to fall back to current manual curation approach (300-500 examples).
