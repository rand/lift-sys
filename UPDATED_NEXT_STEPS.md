## Updated Priority Plan

### Immediate Next Steps (This Week - Week 2)

#### Priority 1: Performance Benchmarking (lift-sys-64) üìä
**Why First**: We have a working system, need to measure and document it before expanding

**Tasks**:
1. Measure latencies systematically:
   - NLP ‚Üí IR generation (Modal)
   - IR ‚Üí Code generation (Modal)
   - End-to-end workflow
   - Cold start vs warm requests
2. Calculate costs:
   - Cost per request (Modal)
   - Estimated monthly costs at various scales
3. Document performance characteristics:
   - Create `PERFORMANCE_METRICS.md`
   - Add to README
   - Compare to targets (<5s E2E goal from plan)
4. Identify bottlenecks:
   - What's slowest?
   - What can be optimized?

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics documented
- ‚úÖ Cost per request calculated
- ‚úÖ Bottlenecks identified
- ‚úÖ Comparison to targets

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

#### Priority 2: Expand Test Coverage üß™
**Why Next**: Validate system works beyond the 2 test cases

**Tasks**:
1. Create test suite with 10-15 diverse prompts:
   - Simple functions (math, string manipulation)
   - Functions with control flow (if/else, loops)
   - Functions with data structures (lists, dicts)
   - Functions with error handling
   - Functions with external dependencies
2. Run E2E tests for each prompt
3. Measure success rates:
   - % that generate valid IR
   - % that compile
   - % that pass tests
4. Document results and patterns:
   - What works well?
   - What fails?
   - Common issues?

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ 10+ prompts tested
- ‚úÖ Success rates measured
- ‚úÖ Patterns documented
- ‚úÖ >70% success rate on simple prompts

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

#### Priority 3: Session Management Investigation (lift-sys-62) üîç
**Why Third**: Need to understand what's broken before fixing

**Tasks**:
1. Run session management tests:
   - Identify which tests fail
   - Categorize failures (provider issues, logic bugs, etc.)
2. Prioritize failures:
   - Critical: Blocks basic workflows
   - Important: Affects features but has workarounds
   - Nice-to-have: Edge cases
3. Fix critical failures only:
   - Focus on top 5-10 most important tests
   - Don't try to fix everything
4. Document remaining issues:
   - What's still broken?
   - What's the impact?
   - What's the plan?

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Test failures categorized
- ‚úÖ Critical failures fixed (<10 remaining)
- ‚úÖ Remaining issues documented

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

---

### Week 2 Deliverables

**By Friday, October 19**:
1. ‚úÖ Performance metrics published (`PERFORMANCE_METRICS.md`)
2. ‚úÖ Expanded test coverage (10+ prompts)
3. ‚úÖ Session management stabilized (<10 critical failures)
4. ‚úÖ Known limitations documented

**NOT in scope for Week 2**:
- ‚ùå LSP test fixes (defer to Week 3 if time)
- ‚ùå Reverse mode E2E test (defer to Week 3)
- ‚ùå Demo video (Week 3)
- ‚ùå Any Phase 5-6 features

---

### Week 3 Priorities (Preliminary)

**Focus**: Demo Preparation & Polish

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful LLM failures
   - Clear error messages
   - User-friendly feedback

2. **Demo Preparation**:
   - Create demo script
   - Record demo video
   - Prepare working examples

3. **Review and Decision**:
   - Assess MVP readiness
   - Decide: ship for feedback or iterate?
   - Plan next phase

---

## Decision: What About the 112 Open Beads?

### Context
The original `MASTER_PLAN.md` created 162 beads for Phases 5-6:
- Phase 5: Reverse Mode Code Analysis (44 beads)
- Phase 6: Production Readiness (68 beads)

These are all marked P0-P1 priority.

### Reality Check Decision

**Status**: **DEFERRED INDEFINITELY**

**Reasoning**:
1. **Pragmatic plan overrides**: REALITY_CHECK_AND_PLAN.md explicitly says we're NOT doing these
2. **Premature optimization**: Can't productionize what doesn't work yet
3. **Resource mismatch**: Would take 6+ months to complete
4. **Wrong priorities**: Need to prove viability first

**Action**:
- Keep beads open but deprioritized
- Focus ONLY on pragmatic plan beads (62, 64, 65)
- Revisit Phase 5-6 IF/WHEN Week 3 succeeds

**Communication**:
- Document in MASTER_PLAN.md that it's superseded by pragmatic plan
- Update bead priorities if possible (or ignore them)
- Focus on 3-week MVP plan, not 6-month plan

## Focused Next Steps (Today)

Based on this review, the immediate actionable next steps are:

### Option A: Performance Benchmarking (Recommended)
Start lift-sys-64 immediately:
1. Create performance test script
2. Run systematic measurements
3. Document results in `PERFORMANCE_METRICS.md`
4. Update README with metrics

**Why**: We have working system, need to measure it

### Option B: Expand Test Coverage
Create diverse prompt test suite:
1. Define 10-15 test prompts
2. Run E2E tests for each
3. Measure success rates
4. Document patterns

**Why**: Validates system beyond 2 examples

### Option C: Session Management Triage
Investigate session test failures:
1. Run session tests
2. Categorize failures
3. Fix top 5 critical issues
4. Document remaining issues

**Why**: Session management is core feature

---

## Recommendation

**Start with Option A (Performance Benchmarking)**

**Reasoning**:
1. **Quick win**: Can complete in 1-2 days
2. **High value**: Need metrics for decision-making
3. **No dependencies**: Can work independently
4. **Clear scope**: Well-defined deliverable

**After benchmarking, choose between**:
- Option B (if performance is good ‚Üí validate with more tests)
- Option C (if performance reveals issues ‚Üí investigate)

---

## Success Metrics for Week 2

### Must Have
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics published
- ‚úÖ 10+ prompts tested with success rates
- ‚úÖ Session management has <10 critical failures

### Nice to Have
- ‚úÖ Cost analysis complete
- ‚úÖ LSP tests improved (if time)
- ‚úÖ Demo script drafted (early start for Week 3)

### Stretch Goals
- ‚úÖ 80%+ success rate on simple prompts
- ‚úÖ <10s E2E latency achieved
- ‚úÖ All critical test suites stable

---

## Long-Term Perspective

### 3-Week MVP Goal
**Week 1**: ‚úÖ Prove it works
**Week 2**: ‚è≥ Measure and validate
**Week 3**: üéØ Demo and decide

### Decision Point (End of Week 3)
**If successful**:
- Ship MVP for user testing
- Gather feedback
- Plan Phase 2 based on feedback

**If not successful**:
- Reassess viability
- Consider pivot or alternate approach
- Update stakeholders

### Phase 5-6 Beads
**Status**: Shelved until MVP proven
**Rationale**: Can't productionize unproven tech
**Timeline**: Revisit in Q1 2026 if MVP succeeds

---

## Summary

**Current Status**: Week 1 complete, all goals exceeded, 100% test pass rate

**Week 2 Focus**: Measure, validate, stabilize

**Immediate Next Step**: Performance benchmarking (lift-sys-64)

**Decision Made**: Deprioritize 112 Phase 5-6 beads, focus on 3-week MVP

**Confidence**: HIGH - proven foundation, clear path forward

---

**Next Action**: Start lift-sys-64 (Performance Benchmarking)
**Estimated Completion**: 1-2 days
**After That**: Expand test coverage OR session management triage
