# Development Records

This directory contains all development-related documentation including test reports, assessments, plans, and summaries.

## Purpose

The `development_records/` directory is used to organize and archive:
- Test reports and assessments
- Development and improvement plans
- Phase summaries and evaluations
- Quality assurance documentation
- Technical investigation reports

## Current Documents

### Test Reports
- **COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_REPORT.md**: Initial comprehensive system testing report
- **TEST_FIXES_SUMMARY.md**: Summary of Phase 1 critical fixes completion
- **PHASE_2_ASSESSMENT.md**: Investigation and assessment of test infrastructure improvements

### Planning Documents
- **DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md**: Original development roadmap and phase tracking
- **IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md**: Phased improvement plan based on test findings

## Guidelines for Future Documentation

When creating new development records:

1. **Use descriptive filenames** with UPPERCASE and underscores
   - Format: `{TYPE}_{TOPIC}_{VERSION}.md`
   - Examples: `TEST_REPORT_v0.3.0.md`, `PERFORMANCE_ASSESSMENT_2025-11.md`

2. **Include metadata header** in each document:
   ```markdown
   # Document Title
   **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
   **Version**: X.Y.Z
   **Status**: Draft/Complete/Archived
   ```

3. **Document types** to include here:
   - Test reports and results
   - Performance assessments
   - Security audits
   - Architecture decision records
   - Improvement and development plans
   - Phase completion summaries
   - Investigation reports

4. **Archive old documents** by appending version/date:
   - When creating a new version of an existing document
   - Move the old one to `archive/` subdirectory (create if needed)
