# ACE-Inspired Enhancements: Implementation Proposal

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Proposed (No Code Changes Yet)
**Based On**: ACE_RESEARCH_ANALYSIS.md

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing ACE (Agentic Context Engineering), I recommend **6 enhancements** to our Semantic IR implementation. Three are **high-priority for Phase 3** (2-3 weeks effort), three are **optional for Phase 6/post-MVP** (1.5-2 weeks effort).

**Key Insight**: ACE solves the exact problem we'll face in iterative IR refinement - **preventing quality degradation** during multi-turn refinement.

**Decision Required**: Adopt high-priority enhancements in Phase 3?

## High-Priority Enhancements (Phase 3)

### Enhancement A: Delta-Based IR Updates ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: CRITICAL | **Effort**: 3-4 days | **Priority**: P0

#### What:
Replace full IR rewrites with incremental delta updates during refinement.

```python
@dataclass
class IRDelta:
    """ACE-inspired incremental IR updates"""
    add: List[IRElement]        # New entities, types, constraints
    update: Dict[str, Any]      # Modified elements (by ID)
    remove: List[str]           # Removed element IDs
    metadata: UpdateMetadata    # Timestamp, user, confidence
    reason: str                 # Why this change was made

# Current (BAD - causes spec collapse):
new_ir = regenerate_entire_ir(old_ir, user_input)  # Loses detail

# With ACE (GOOD):
delta = curator.create_delta(user_input, current_ir)
new_ir = apply_delta(current_ir, delta)  # Preserves all unchanged elements
```

#### Why:
- **Prevents "Spec Collapse"**: Like ACE prevents context collapse, this prevents IR from degrading during refinement
- **Clear Audit Trail**: Every change tracked, easy to undo
- **Faster**: Only process deltas, not entire IR
- **Better UX**: User sees what changed

#### Changes Required:
1. Create `IRDelta` data model (Phase 1.1.1 extension)
2. Implement `apply_delta()` function (Phase 3.3.1)
3. Update all refinement operations to produce deltas
4. Add delta history tracking for undo/redo
5. Update frontend to show delta diffs

#### Example User Flow:
```
User resolves hole: "function_name" → "calculate_sum"

OLD BEHAVIOR:
- System regenerates entire IR
- Risk: Might change unrelated parts
- User sees: Whole IR replaced

NEW BEHAVIOR (ACE-inspired):
- System creates delta: {update: {"hole_function_name": {"resolved": "calculate_sum"}}}
- Risk: Zero (only targeted change)
- User sees: "✅ Updated: function_name → calculate_sum"
```

#### New Bead Item:
**lift-sys-167**: "ACE Enhancement A: Delta-Based IR Updates"
- File: `lift_sys/ir/delta_operations.py` (~300 lines new)
- Update: `lift_sys/refinement/propagation_engine.py`
- **Estimate**: 3-4 days
- **Depends on**: lift-sys-70 (Enhanced IR Data Models)
- **Blocks**: lift-sys-112 (IR Update Propagation) - will use deltas

---

### Enhancement B: Inference Rule Quality Tracking ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: HIGH | **Effort**: 2-3 days | **Priority**: P0

#### What:
Add ACE-style helpful/harmful counters to inference rules, track which rules produce good suggestions.

```python
@dataclass
class InferenceRule:
    id: str
    pattern: str                # "delete X" → "X must exist"
    reasoning_type: ReasoningType

    # NEW: ACE-inspired tracking
    helpful_count: int = 0      # User accepted suggestions from this rule
    harmful_count: int = 0      # User rejected/corrected suggestions
    confidence: float = 0.5     # Computed: helpful / (helpful + harmful + 1)

    last_helpful: datetime
    last_harmful: datetime
    domains: List[str]          # Where this rule works well

    def record_feedback(self, accepted: bool, domain: Optional[str] = None):
        """Update counters based on user feedback"""
        if accepted:
            self.helpful_count += 1
            self.last_helpful = datetime.now()
            if domain and domain not in self.domains:
                self.domains.append(domain)
        else:
            self.harmful_count += 1
            self.last_harmful = datetime.now()

        # Recompute confidence (ACE formula with smoothing)
        total = self.helpful_count + self.harmful_count
        self.confidence = (self.helpful_count + 1) / (total + 2)
```

#### Why:
- **Self-Improving**: Rules get better with usage, like ACE playbooks
- **Better Suggestions**: High-confidence rules ranked higher
- **Automatic Pruning**: Low-confidence rules ignored
- **Domain Learning**: Discover which rules work where

#### Changes Required:
1. Add tracking fields to `InferenceRule` class
2. Implement feedback collection when user accepts/rejects suggestions
3. Update `SuggestionRanker` to use confidence scores
4. Add periodic pruning (remove confidence < 0.3)
5. Add UI to show rule confidence in hover tooltips

#### Example:
```
Rule: "send X" → infer "X has recipient" parameter

Initial: confidence = 0.5 (neutral)

Session 1: User accepts suggestion → confidence = 0.67 (2/3)
Session 2: User accepts suggestion → confidence = 0.75 (3/4)
Session 3: User accepts suggestion → confidence = 0.80 (4/5)

Result: Rule now prioritized in suggestion ranking
```

### Enhancement C: Three-Role Architecture Refactor ⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: 1-2 days | **Priority**: P1

#### What:
Refactor existing pipeline into ACE's Generator/Reflector/Curator roles for clearer architecture.

```python
# Current architecture (implicit roles):
# prompt → IR generator → ambiguity detector → suggestion generator → update IR

# ACE-inspired architecture (explicit roles):
class IRGenerator:
    """Generates initial IR from prompt (ACE Generator role)"""
    async def generate(self, prompt: str) -> EnhancedIR:
        # Existing functionality from Phase 1
        pass

class IRReflector:
    """Analyzes IR quality, detects issues (ACE Reflector role)"""
    async def reflect(self, ir: EnhancedIR,
                     user_feedback: Optional[Feedback] = None) -> List[Issue]:
        """
        Critiques IR to find:
        - Ambiguities (Phase 2.2)
        - Missing constraints (Phase 2.2.3)
        - Typed holes (Phase 1.3)
        - Implicit terms (Phase 2.3)
        """
        # Wraps existing ambiguity detection
        pass

class IRCurator:
    """Curates suggestions and applies deltas (ACE Curator role)"""
    async def curate_suggestions(self, issues: List[Issue],
                                 ir: EnhancedIR) -> List[Suggestion]:
        """Generate ranked suggestions for each issue"""
        # Wraps existing suggestion generation (Phase 3.2)
        pass

    async def apply_refinement(self, suggestion: Suggestion,
                               ir: EnhancedIR) -> IRDelta:
        """Create delta update from accepted suggestion"""
        # Uses Enhancement A (delta-based updates)
        pass
```

#### Why:
- **Proven Pattern**: ACE's architecture tested on real benchmarks
- **Clear Separation**: Each role has one job
- **Easier Testing**: Mock each role independently
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and extend

#### Changes Required:
1. Create `IRGenerator` class (wrap existing prompt→IR logic)
2. Create `IRReflector` class (wrap ambiguity detection)
3. Create `IRCurator` class (wrap suggestion generation + delta application)
4. Update orchestration layer to use three roles
5. Update tests to use role-based mocking

#### New Bead Item:
**lift-sys-169**: "ACE Enhancement C: Three-Role Architecture Refactor"
- Files: `lift_sys/refinement/roles.py` (~400 lines new)
- Update: Multiple existing modules to use roles
- **Estimate**: 1-2 days (mostly refactoring, minimal new code)
- **Depends on**: lift-sys-107 (Refinement State Management)
- **Enhances**: lift-sys-108-111 (Suggestion System)

---

## Optional Enhancements (Phase 6 / Post-MVP)

### Enhancement D: Semantic Suggestion Deduplication ⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: 1-2 days | **Priority**: P1

#### What:
Use embeddings to remove semantically duplicate suggestions (ACE technique).

```python
class SuggestionDeduplicator:
    """ACE-inspired semantic deduplication"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.embed = OpenAI().embeddings.create  # text-embedding-3-small

    def deduplicate(self, suggestions: List[Suggestion],
                   threshold: float = 0.90) -> List[Suggestion]:
        """Remove semantically similar suggestions"""
        unique = []
        for sugg in suggestions:
            emb = self.embed(input=sugg.text).data[0].embedding

            # Check similarity to existing
            is_dup = any(
                cosine_similarity(emb, self.embed(input=u.text).data[0].embedding) > threshold
                for u in unique
            )

            if not is_dup:
                unique.append(sugg)

        return unique
```

**Benefits**: Cleaner suggestion lists, better UX

**New Bead**: lift-sys-170 (P1, defer to Phase 6)

---

### Enhancement E: Cross-Session Knowledge Persistence ⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: 4-5 days | **Priority**: P2

#### What:
Persistent user/project "playbook" like ACE (accumulated knowledge across sessions).

```python
class UserPlaybook:
    """ACE-inspired persistent knowledge base"""

    user_id: str
    learned_patterns: List[InferenceRule]     # High-confidence rules from past sessions
    domain_vocabulary: Dict[str, TypeDef]     # User-defined types
    common_constraints: List[Constraint]      # Reusable constraints

    def update_from_session(self, session: RefinementSession):
        """Extract reusable knowledge after session completes"""
        # Successful inferences → add to patterns
        # User-defined types → add to vocabulary
        # Frequently used constraints → add to library
```

**Example**:
```
Session 1: User defines "EmailAddress" type
   → Playbook: Stores EmailAddress = str with regex

Session 2: Prompt mentions "email address"
   → System: "Did you mean EmailAddress type from Session 1?"
```

**Benefits**: Faster refinement for power users, consistency

**New Bead**: lift-sys-171 (P2, defer to post-MVP)

---

### Enhancement F: Multi-Pass Suggestion Refinement ⭐⭐
**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM | **Effort**: 2 days | **Priority**: P2

#### What:
ACE Reflector-style iteration on suggestions (generate, critique, improve).

```python
async def refine_suggestion(initial: str, context: IRContext) -> Suggestion:
    """Two-pass refinement like ACE Reflector"""

    # Pass 1: Generate suggestion
    suggestion_v1 = await llm.generate(initial, context)

    # Pass 2: Critique and improve
    critique = await llm.generate(f"Critique this suggestion: {suggestion_v1}")
    suggestion_v2 = await llm.generate(f"Improve based on: {critique}")

    return suggestion_v2
```

**Trade-offs**: 2x latency, 2x cost, but higher quality

**New Bead**: lift-sys-172 (P2, optional quality improvement)

---

## Comparison: ACE vs. MuSLR Enhancements

| Aspect | ACE | MuSLR | Winner |
|--------|-----|-------|--------|
| **Relevance** | High (exact problem) | Medium (related concepts) | ✅ ACE |
| **Impact** | High (prevents degradation) | Medium (explainability) | ✅ ACE |
| **Effort** | 2-3 weeks | 6 days | 🟡 MuSLR |
| **Priority** | P0 (critical) | P0-P2 (mixed) | ✅ ACE |
| **ROI** | Very High | Medium | ✅ ACE |

**Recommendation**: Prioritize ACE high-priority items (A, B, C) over MuSLR enhancements.

If schedule is tight, implement in this order:
1. ACE A (Delta Updates) - P0, most critical
2. ACE B (Rule Quality) - P0, high value
3. MuSLR 1 (Confidence Levels) - P0, complements ACE B
4. ACE C (Three-Role Arch) - P1, nice refactor
5. MuSLR 2-4 - P2, defer

---

## Questions for Decision

1. **Is preventing IR degradation critical?** (If yes → Adopt ACE A - Delta Updates)
2. **Should suggestions improve over time?** (If yes → Adopt ACE B - Rule Quality)
3. **Is architectural clarity important?** (If yes → Adopt ACE C - Three Roles)
4. **Can we afford 2-3 weeks in Phase 3?** (If yes → Option A; if no → reconsider)

**Decision Deadline**: Before starting Phase 3 implementation

---

## Recommendation Summary

**I strongly recommend Option A: Adopt high-priority ACE enhancements (A, B, C) in Phase 3.**

**Rationale**:
1. **ACE solves our core problem**: Iterative refinement without quality degradation
2. **Proven approach**: +10.6% on real benchmarks, open-source reference
3. **Manageable effort**: 2-3 weeks for critical quality improvements
4. **High ROI**: Prevents major issues that would cost more to fix later

**Alternative**: If schedule is very tight, adopt only ACE A (Delta Updates) as P0, defer B and C.

---

**Status**: Awaiting user decision on Option A, B, or C.
