## Technology 1: llguidance

**Repository**: https://github.com/guidance-ai/llguidance
**Category**: Constrained Generation (Grammar-based)
**Status**: v1.0.0 (June 2025), Production-ready

### Overview

llguidance implements constrained decoding for LLMs, enforcing arbitrary context-free grammars on model outputs. Initially developed as the backend for the Guidance library, it can be used independently and has been adopted by OpenAI to power their Structured Outputs feature.

**Key Innovation**: Combines extremely fast token masking (~50μs per token) with support for JSON schemas and context-free grammars, making constrained generation practical for production use.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Grammar Support
- **JSON Schemas**: Supports large subset of JSON schema specification
- **Regular Expressions**: Full regex support embedded in grammars
- **Context-Free Grammars**: Lark-like syntax for arbitrary CFGs
- **Internal Format**: JSON-based format (being deprecated in favor of Lark syntax)

#### 2. Performance
- **Token Masking**: ~50μs CPU time per token (128k tokenizer)
- **Startup Time**: ~2ms (negligible)
- **Batch Processing**: Can handle batch sizes up to 3200 with 16 cores and 10ms forward pass
- **Benchmark**: 10-1000x faster than competing libraries (LM-format-enforcer, llama.cpp grammars)

#### 3. Integration Support
- **OpenAI**: Powers Structured Outputs feature directly
- **Self-Hosted**: llama.cpp, vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, mistral.rs, onnxruntime-genai
- **Browser**: Chromium (window.ai JSON Schema enforcement)
- **Anthropic**: Limited/discontinued support in Guidance library (as of 2024-2025)

### Evaluation for lift-sys

#### ✅ IR Schema Enforcement (Score: 5/5)

**Can it enforce lift-sys's IR JSON schema with 100% reliability?**
- **YES**: llguidance's primary strength is JSON schema enforcement
- Powers OpenAI's Structured Outputs which achieved "perfect 100%" score
- Fast enough for interactive use (~50μs per token)

**Evidence**:
- Adopted by OpenAI for production structured outputs
- "Can enforce arbitrary context-free grammar on the output of LLM"
- Full mask computation for typical JSON schema: ~1.5ms

**For lift-sys IR**:
```python
# lift-sys IR schema can be enforced directly
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "intent": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
    "signature": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "string" },
        "parameters": { "type": "array" },
        "returns": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["name", "parameters", "returns"]
    },
    "assertions": { "type": "array" }
  },
  "required": ["intent", "signature"]
}
```

**Limitations**:
- Supports "large subset" of JSON schemas, not 100% complete
- Complex nested schemas may have edge cases

#### ✅ Type Constraints (Score: 5/5)

**Can it enforce Python type grammar for code generation?**
- **YES**: Context-free grammars can express Python type syntax
- Regular expressions can match type patterns
- Composable grammars allow mixing JSON schema + custom rules

**Example Grammar** (hypothetical for Python types):
```lark
type_hint: simple_type | union_type | generic_type
simple_type: "int" | "str" | "bool" | "float" | "None"
union_type: type_hint " | " type_hint
generic_type: NAME "[" type_hint ("," type_hint)* "]"
```

**For lift-sys**:
- Can enforce `Parameter.type_hint` matches Python type grammar
- Can ensure `SigClause.returns` is valid Python return type
- Can validate type hints in TypedHoles

**Limitations**:
- Requires defining custom grammars for each language's type system
- Python's type hints are complex (PEP 484, 585, 604, etc.)
- May not cover 100% of Python typing features (TypeVar, Protocol, etc.)

#### ⚠️  SMT Integration (Score: 4/5)

**Can we integrate with Z3 for SMT verification during generation?**
- **PARTIALLY**: llguidance itself doesn't integrate with SMT solvers
- However, it provides the foundation for a pipeline:
  1. llguidance enforces syntax (type hints, structure)
  2. Generated code/IR passed to Z3 for semantic verification
  3. If Z3 fails, regenerate with additional constraints

**Integration Architecture**:
```
Prompt + IR Schema
    ↓
[llguidance] Enforce JSON schema + type syntax
    ↓
Syntactically valid IR
    ↓
[Extract AssertClauses]
    ↓
[Z3] Verify logical consistency
    ↓
If ✅: Accept IR
If ❌: Add constraint to grammar, regenerate
```

**Not a limitation of llguidance**: It's designed for syntactic constraints, not semantic verification. We'd need to build the SMT integration layer ourselves.

**Score justification**: 4/5 because llguidance enables the pipeline but doesn't provide SMT integration out-of-the-box.

#### ⚠️  Parallel Decoding (Score: 3/5)

**Can it support parallel speculative decoding for TypedHole resolution?**
- **PARTIALLY**: llguidance can generate token masks for multiple branches simultaneously
- Not designed specifically for parallel speculative decoding
- Would need integration with speculative decoding framework

**Potential Architecture**:
```
TypedHole with 3 possible types: str | dict | list
    ↓
Generate 3 grammars in parallel:
  Grammar A: type_hint = "str"
  Grammar B: type_hint = "dict"
  Grammar C: type_hint = "list"
    ↓
[llguidance] Compute masks for each grammar
    ↓
[Speculative Decoder] Generate all 3 branches in parallel
    ↓
[User] Select best option
```

**Limitations**:
- llguidance doesn't implement parallel decoding itself
- Would need to integrate with SpecExec or similar
- Adds complexity to the generation pipeline

**Score justification**: 3/5 because it enables the approach but requires additional integration work.

#### ❌ Semantic Context (Score: 2/5)

**Can it provide codebase-aware semantic information?**
- **NO**: llguidance is purely syntactic
- No language server integration
- No codebase context retrieval
- No type inference from usage

**This is not llguidance's job**: It's designed for grammar enforcement, not semantic understanding.

**For lift-sys**: We'd combine llguidance with ChatLSP:
1. llguidance ensures syntax validity
2. ChatLSP provides semantic context and error correction
3. Together: syntax-valid + semantically-appropriate code

**Score justification**: 2/5 because it doesn't provide semantic context (by design).

#### ⚠️  Multi-Language Support (Score: 3/5)

**Can it support Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, etc.?**
- **YES, with effort**: Context-free grammars can express any language syntax
- Grammar definition is language-agnostic
- Already used across multiple integration points

**Current Language Support**:
- **JSON**: Excellent (built-in)
- **Python**: Possible (requires custom grammar definition)
- **TypeScript**: Possible (requires custom grammar definition)
- **Rust**: Possible (requires custom grammar definition)
- **Go**: Possible (requires custom grammar definition)

**How to Add a New Language**:
1. Define type system grammar in Lark syntax (~100-500 lines)
2. Define code structure grammar (function defs, etc.)
3. Test with sample IR → code generation
4. **Estimated effort**: 1-3 days per language for basic support

**Example: TypeScript Type Grammar** (simplified):
```lark
ts_type: primitive | union | intersection | generic | literal
primitive: "string" | "number" | "boolean" | "null" | "undefined"
union: ts_type " | " ts_type
intersection: ts_type " & " ts_type
generic: NAME "<" ts_type ("," ts_type)* ">"
literal: STRING | NUMBER
```

**Limitations**:
- Each language requires manual grammar definition
- Complex type systems (Rust ownership, TypeScript conditional types) are hard to express
- No pre-built grammars for common languages
- Grammar maintenance burden as languages evolve

**Comparison to xgrammar**:
- xgrammar likely has better multi-language support out-of-the-box
- llguidance requires more manual work per language
- Both are theoretically capable of supporting any language

**Score justification**: 3/5 because multi-language support is possible but requires significant effort per language. Not as seamless as a truly language-agnostic system.

#### ✅ Maturity (Score: 4/5)

**Is it production-ready?**
- **YES**: v1.0.0 released June 2025
- Adopted by OpenAI for Structured Outputs (major validation)
- Integrated into multiple production systems (llama.cpp, vLLM, Chromium)
- Developed at Microsoft Research (2023-2025)

**Evidence of Maturity**:
- Used by OpenAI in production API
- Multiple integration points prove stability
- Active development and maintenance
- Clear documentation and examples

**Remaining Concerns**:
- JSON schema support is "large subset", not 100%
- Anthropic support discontinued (though not critical for llguidance itself)
- Internal format being deprecated (migration path exists)

**Score justification**: 4/5 because it's production-ready with proven adoption, but some features are incomplete.

#### ✅ Integration Effort (Score: 3/5)

**How easy is it to integrate into lift-sys?**
- **MODERATE**: Requires self-hosted LLM infrastructure OR OpenAI API
- Python bindings available via PyPI
- Clear integration path with vLLM

**Integration Options for lift-sys**:

**Option 1: vLLM + llguidance (Self-hosted)**
```python
from llguidance import LLGuidance
from vllm import LLM

# Define IR JSON schema
ir_schema = {...}

# Initialize llguidance with schema
guidance = LLGuidance(schema=ir_schema)

# Initialize vLLM with guidance
llm = LLM(model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B", grammar_backend="llguidance")

# Generate constrained output
output = llm.generate(prompt, guidance=guidance)
```

**Option 2: OpenAI Structured Outputs API**
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Define IR JSON schema
ir_schema = {...}

# Generate with structured output
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    response_format={"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": ir_schema}
)
```

**Option 3: llama.cpp + llguidance (Self-hosted)**
- Compile llama.cpp with `-DLLAMA_LLGUIDANCE=ON`
- Use llguidance API for constrained generation

**Integration Steps**:
1. **Week 1**: Set up vLLM with llguidance or OpenAI Structured Outputs
2. **Week 2**: Define IR JSON schema, test enforcement
3. **Week 3**: Define Python type grammar for code generation
4. **Week 4**: Integrate with `lift_sys/spec_sessions/translator.py`
5. **Week 5**: Testing and refinement

**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 weeks for full integration

**Challenges**:
- Requires self-hosted LLM infrastructure (unless using OpenAI)
- Grammar definition for Python types requires expertise
- No official Anthropic support (would need workaround)
- Limited documentation on complex grammar patterns

**Score justification**: 3/5 because integration is straightforward with clear options, but requires infrastructure setup and custom grammar work.

#### ✅ Impact (Score: 5/5)

**What's the potential to improve lift-sys?**
- **VERY HIGH**: Solves the #1 critical gap (Prompt → IR translation)
- Enables reliable IR generation (100% valid JSON)
- Unblocks forward mode entirely
- Fast enough for interactive use

**Expected Improvements**:
- **IR Generation**: 0% → 95%+ success rate (from regex stubs to real LLM)
- **IR Validity**: 100% valid JSON (no parsing errors)
- **Latency**: <2s for typical IR generation (50μs per token × ~20k tokens)
- **User Experience**: Immediate, visible improvement

**Comparison to Status Quo**:
- **Current**: Regex heuristics, fails on anything non-trivial
- **With llguidance**: Real LLM understanding + guaranteed valid IR structure

**Secondary Benefits**:
- Enables type-safe code generation (Python type grammar)
- Foundation for multi-language support (define grammar per language)
- Can be combined with ChatLSP for semantic correctness
- Can be combined with SMT verification for logical correctness

**Score justification**: 5/5 because it directly solves the most critical gap and enables the entire forward mode pipeline.

### Summary Scorecard

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| IR Schema | 5/5 | Perfect for JSON schema enforcement, adopted by OpenAI |
| Type Constraints | 5/5 | CFG can express type grammars, requires definition work |
| SMT Integration | 4/5 | Enables pipeline but doesn't integrate directly |
| Parallel Decoding | 3/5 | Supports multi-branch but requires integration |
| Semantic Context | 2/5 | Not designed for this, use ChatLSP instead |
| Multi-Language | 3/5 | Possible but requires grammar per language |
| Maturity | 4/5 | Production-ready, OpenAI adoption validates |
| Integration | 3/5 | Moderate effort, requires infra + custom grammars |
| Impact | 5/5 | Solves #1 critical gap, unblocks forward mode |

**Total Score**: 34/45 (75.6%)

**Priority**: **P0** (Must integrate for forward mode to work)

### Recommendation

**ADOPT llguidance for lift-sys**, specifically for:

1. **Prompt → IR translation** (Phase 1 integration)
   - Enforce IR JSON schema with 100% reliability
   - Eliminate parsing errors
   - Enable real LLM-based translation

2. **IR → Code generation** (Phase 2 integration)
   - Define Python type grammar
   - Enforce type hints match IR constraints
   - Generate syntactically valid code

3. **Future: Multi-language support** (Phase 3 integration)
   - Define TypeScript, Rust, Go grammars as needed
   - Build grammar library for common languages
   - Create language plugin architecture

**Deployment Strategy**:
- **Short-term**: Use OpenAI Structured Outputs API (fastest path to value)
- **Medium-term**: Deploy vLLM with llguidance (more control, lower cost)
- **Long-term**: Consider self-hosted llama.cpp for full control

**Combine With**:
- **ChatLSP**: For semantic correctness and error correction (3x improvement)
- **Z3**: For SMT verification of assertions (logical correctness)
- **Parallel Decoding**: For TypedHole resolution (explore alternatives)

**Expected Timeline**:
- **Week 1**: OpenAI Structured Outputs POC for IR generation
- **Week 2-3**: Define Python type grammar, test code generation
- **Week 4-5**: Full integration with translator and codegen
- **Week 6+**: TypeScript grammar for multi-language support

### Open Questions

1. **Anthropic Support**: How critical is Claude support? Can we use OpenAI for forward mode and Claude for other tasks?
2. **Grammar Complexity**: How much effort to fully express Python's type system (TypeVar, Protocol, Generic, etc.)?
3. **Performance at Scale**: How does latency scale with complex, deeply nested IRs?
4. **Grammar Maintenance**: Who maintains grammars as languages evolve?
5. **Custom Grammar vs. Pre-built**: Should we wait for xgrammar's pre-built grammars or build our own with llguidance?

### Next Steps

1. **POC Experiment**: Generate 20 test IRs using OpenAI Structured Outputs
   - Measure success rate (target: 100% valid JSON)
   - Measure latency (target: <2s per IR)
   - Test deeply nested IRs (10+ AssertClauses)

2. **Grammar Definition**: Write Python type grammar in Lark syntax
   - Cover common type hints (list, dict, Union, Optional, etc.)
   - Test with IR→code generation
   - Measure type safety improvements

3. **Integration Planning**: Design lift-sys integration architecture
   - Where does llguidance fit in the pipeline?
   - How to combine with ChatLSP and Z3?
   - What's the fallback if llguidance fails?

## Technology 2: AICI (AI Controller Interface)

**Repository**: https://github.com/microsoft/aici
**Category**: Constrained Generation (Controller-based)
**Status**: Prototype (Microsoft Research)

### Overview

AICI (AI Controller Interface) is a WebAssembly-based framework for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) token generation. It provides a lightweight VM that runs alongside the LLM inference engine, allowing real-time interaction and constraint enforcement during text generation through programmable "controllers."

**Key Innovation**: Instead of static grammars (like llguidance), AICI provides a programmable interface where developers write Wasm controllers that can dynamically constrain generation, backtrack, fork, and coordinate multiple generation branches.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Controller Architecture
- **WebAssembly VM**: Controllers are Wasm modules running on CPU in parallel with GPU inference
- **Three-Stage Control**:
  1. `pre_process()`: Decide to stop/fork/continue generation
  2. `mid_process()`: Constrain generation, apply logit biases
  3. `post_process()`: Update internal state
- **Dynamic Constraints**: Can change constraints mid-generation based on previous tokens

#### 2. Constraint Types
- **Token-level**: Restrict allowed tokens at each step
- **Grammar-based**: Regular expressions, context-free grammars (via tries)
- **Programmatic**: Arbitrary Wasm logic for constraint checking
- **Backtracking**: Can backtrack and explore alternative paths
- **Forking**: Can create multiple parallel generation branches
- **Editing**: Can dynamically edit prompts and generated text

#### 3. Performance
- **Overhead**: Wasm runs ~2x slower than native code (minimal overhead)
- **Constraint Computation**: 0.2-2.0ms per token
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs on CPU while GPU generates tokens
- **Total Generation Step**: 20-50ms (constraint check is small fraction)

#### 4. Integration Support
- **Current**: llama.cpp, HuggingFace Transformers, rLLM (custom PyTorch engine)
- **Planned**: vLLM
- **Cloud Providers**: Self-hosted only (no OpenAI/Anthropic integration)

#### 5. Programming Languages
- **Controller Languages**: Any language compiling to Wasm (Rust, C, C++)
- **Embedded Interpreters**: Python (RustPython), JavaScript
- **Rust Library**: `aici_abi` simplifies controller development

### Evaluation for lift-sys

#### ✅ IR Schema Enforcement (Score: 5/5)

**Can it enforce lift-sys's IR JSON schema with 100% reliability?**
- **YES**: Controllers can enforce JSON schema using grammar constraints
- Can use `pyctrl` (Python controller) or `jsctrl` (JavaScript controller) for flexible schema enforcement
- Rust-based controllers can use tries and CFG for efficient checking

**Example Controller Approach** (pseudocode):
```python
# Using pyctrl (Python controller in Wasm)
import aici
from aici import FixedTokens, JsonSchema

# Define IR JSON schema
ir_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "intent": {"type": "array"},
        "signature": {"type": "object"},
        "assertions": {"type": "array"}
    }
}

# Controller enforces schema
class IRController(aici.Controller):
    def mid_process(self):
        # Use JsonSchema constraint
        self.constrain(JsonSchema(ir_schema))
```

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅ More flexible: Can change schema mid-generation
- ✅ Programmatic: Can add custom validation logic
- ✅ Backtracking: Can recover from invalid paths

**Limitations**:
- ❌ May be slower than llguidance's optimized JSON schema enforcement
- ❌ Requires writing controller code (not just providing schema)
- ❌ Less mature than llguidance for JSON schema specifically

**Score justification**: 5/5 because it can enforce JSON schema reliably, with even more flexibility than llguidance, though potentially slower.

#### ✅ Type Constraints (Score: 4/5)

**Can it enforce Python type grammar for code generation?**
- **YES**: Controllers can enforce CFG and regex for type syntax
- Can use `aici_abi` Rust library's trie-based constraint checking
- Can implement custom type system logic in Wasm

**Example Controller Approach**:
```rust
// Rust controller for Python type hints
use aici_abi::*;

#[derive(Clone)]
struct PythonTypeController {
    grammar: ContextFreeGrammar,
}

impl Controller for PythonTypeController {
    fn mid_process(&mut self, tokens: &[Token]) -> MidProcessResult {
        // Constrain tokens to match Python type grammar
        let allowed_tokens = self.grammar.allowed_tokens(tokens);
        MidProcessResult::constrain(allowed_tokens)
    }
}
```

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅ Can implement complex type system logic (e.g., Rust ownership checks)
- ✅ Can validate types against codebase context (query language server from Wasm)
- ✅ Can backtrack if type inference fails

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️  Requires implementing type grammar in controller code (more work than llguidance)
- ⚠️  May be slower than llguidance's optimized CFG enforcement
- ⚠️  Rust controller development has learning curve

**Score justification**: 4/5 because it's very capable but requires more implementation effort than llguidance.

#### ✅ SMT Integration (Score: 5/5)

**Can we integrate with Z3 for SMT verification during generation?**
- **YES**: This is AICI's strength! Controllers can call external services mid-generation
- Can implement Z3 verification directly in controller
- Can backtrack if SMT check fails

**Example Controller Approach**:
```python
# Python controller with Z3 integration
import aici
from z3 import *

class SMTVerifiedController(aici.Controller):
    def __init__(self):
        self.solver = Solver()

    def mid_process(self):
        # Generate potential IR assertion
        assertion = self.get_generated_text()

        # Convert to Z3 and check
        z3_constraint = self.parse_to_z3(assertion)
        self.solver.add(z3_constraint)

        if self.solver.check() == unsat:
            # Constraint unsatisfiable, backtrack!
            self.backtrack()
        else:
            # Continue generation
            self.continue_generation()
```

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅✅ Can integrate SMT checking directly in generation loop
- ✅✅ Can backtrack automatically when SMT check fails
- ✅✅ Can coordinate between multiple SMT assertions
- ✅ Much more powerful than llguidance's syntax-only approach

**This is a major differentiator**: AICI can verify semantic correctness during generation, not just after.

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️  Z3 calls add latency (~10-100ms per check)
- ⚠️  Requires careful controller design to balance speed vs. verification
- ⚠️  May need to cache SMT results to avoid repeated checks

**Score justification**: 5/5 because AICI enables true SMT-verified generation with backtracking—exactly what lift-sys needs!

#### ✅ Parallel Decoding (Score: 4/5)

**Can it support parallel speculative decoding for TypedHole resolution?**
- **YES**: AICI natively supports forking and parallel generations!
- Controllers can create multiple branches and explore them simultaneously
- Can communicate between forks

**Example Controller Approach**:
```python
# Python controller for TypedHole resolution
import aici

class TypedHoleController(aici.Controller):
    def pre_process(self):
        # TypedHole with 3 possible types: str | dict | list
        type_options = ["str", "dict", "list"]

        # Fork generation into 3 branches
        for type_hint in type_options:
            fork = self.create_fork()
            fork.set_constraint(f"type_hint = '{type_hint}'")
            fork.continue_generation()

        # All 3 branches generate in parallel
        # User can select best option later
```

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅✅ Native forking and parallel branch support
- ✅✅ Can communicate between branches
- ✅ Can coordinate multiple parallel generations
- ✅ Can merge branches based on SMT verification

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️  Requires careful management of multiple Wasm instances
- ⚠️  May use more memory than sequential generation
- ⚠️  Integration with speculative decoding frameworks (SpecExec) unclear

**Score justification**: 4/5 because AICI has excellent built-in support for parallel branches, though integration with external speculative decoders is unproven.

#### ⚠️  Semantic Context (Score: 2/5)

**Can it provide codebase-aware semantic information?**
- **PARTIALLY**: Controllers can theoretically call external services (language servers)
- Wasm can make network calls (with host function support)
- No built-in semantic context

**Possible Integration**:
```python
# Python controller calling language server
import aici
import http_client  # Hypothetical Wasm HTTP client

class SemanticController(aici.Controller):
    def mid_process(self):
        # Generate code
        code = self.get_generated_text()

        # Call Pyright language server
        response = http_client.post(
            "http://localhost:8080/check",
            {"code": code}
        )

        if response.has_errors():
            # Backtrack and regenerate
            self.backtrack()
```

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅ Can integrate with external services (language servers, databases, etc.)
- ✅ More flexible than static approaches

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Network calls add significant latency (50-200ms)
- ❌ Requires host function support for external calls
- ❌ Wasm sandboxing may limit capabilities
- ❌ Not designed for this use case (ChatLSP is better)

**Score justification**: 2/5 because while theoretically possible, AICI isn't optimized for semantic context (use ChatLSP instead).

#### ⚠️  Multi-Language Support (Score: 3/5)

**Can it support Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, etc.?**
- **YES, with effort**: Controllers are language-agnostic
- Same controller can handle multiple target languages
- Need to define grammar/constraints for each language

**Approach**:
```rust
// Rust controller supporting multiple languages
struct MultiLanguageController {
    target_language: Language,
    grammars: HashMap<Language, Grammar>,
}

impl Controller for MultiLanguageController {
    fn mid_process(&mut self, tokens: &[Token]) -> MidProcessResult {
        let grammar = &self.grammars[&self.target_language];
        let allowed = grammar.allowed_tokens(tokens);
        MidProcessResult::constrain(allowed)
    }
}
```

**Language Support Effort**:
- **Python**: Define grammar + type system (~2-4 days)
- **TypeScript**: Define grammar + type system (~2-4 days)
- **Rust**: Define grammar + ownership system (~4-7 days, complex)
- **Go**: Define grammar + type system (~2-3 days)

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅ Single controller can support multiple languages (code reuse)
- ✅ Can share constraint logic across languages
- ✅ More flexible for language-specific features (Rust ownership)

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️  Still requires manual grammar definition per language
- ⚠️  No pre-built language support
- ⚠️  Similar effort to llguidance for each new language
- ⚠️  Controller code is more complex than llguidance grammars

**Comparison to llguidance**:
- Similar multi-language support (both require grammars per language)
- AICI allows more complex language-specific logic
- llguidance may be easier to get started with

**Score justification**: 3/5 because multi-language support is possible but requires similar effort to llguidance, with more implementation complexity.

#### ⚠️  Maturity (Score: 3/5)

**Is it production-ready?**
- **NO**: Still a prototype from Microsoft Research
- Active development but not yet widely adopted
- Fewer integration points than llguidance

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Developed at Microsoft Research (credibility)
- ✅ Integrates with llama.cpp and HuggingFace Transformers
- ⚠️  vLLM integration "in the works" (not ready)
- ⚠️  No major production adoption (unlike llguidance with OpenAI)
- ❌ Limited documentation and examples
- ❌ No version 1.0 release yet

**Comparison to llguidance**:
- llguidance: v1.0, OpenAI production use, mature
- AICI: Prototype, research project, experimental

**Risks**:
- May have breaking changes
- Limited community support
- Uncertain long-term maintenance
- May not scale to production workloads

**Score justification**: 3/5 because it's a promising research prototype but not production-ready (unlike llguidance).

#### ❌ Integration Effort (Score: 2/5)

**How easy is it to integrate into lift-sys?**
- **HARD**: Requires self-hosted infrastructure AND controller development
- Steeper learning curve than llguidance
- More implementation work

**Integration Requirements**:
1. **Infrastructure**: Self-hosted llama.cpp or HuggingFace Transformers (no cloud API option)
2. **Controller Development**: Write Rust or Python controllers for each use case
3. **Wasm Toolchain**: Set up Wasm compilation if using Rust
4. **Testing**: Extensive testing of controller logic
5. **Maintenance**: Keep controllers updated as AICI evolves

**Integration Steps**:
1. **Week 1-2**: Set up llama.cpp with AICI support
2. **Week 3-4**: Learn AICI controller API, write IR schema controller
3. **Week 5-6**: Implement Python type grammar controller
4. **Week 7-8**: Implement SMT verification controller
5. **Week 9-10**: Testing, refinement, integration with lift-sys
6. **Week 11-12**: Multi-language support (TypeScript, Rust)

**Estimated Effort**: 10-12 weeks for full integration (vs. 4-5 weeks for llguidance)

**Challenges**:
- ❌ Requires Rust knowledge for high-performance controllers
- ❌ Wasm development is less familiar than JSON schema definition
- ❌ Limited documentation and examples
- ❌ Self-hosted infrastructure only (no cloud API shortcut)
- ❌ More moving parts than llguidance
- ❌ Harder to debug than static grammars

**Score justification**: 2/5 because integration requires significantly more effort than llguidance, though it provides more power.

#### ✅ Impact (Score: 4/5)

**What's the potential to improve lift-sys?**
- **HIGH**: Enables capabilities llguidance can't (SMT integration, backtracking, forking)
- More powerful than llguidance for complex constraint graphs
- Better for TypedHole resolution (native parallel branch support)

**Expected Improvements**:
- **IR Generation**: 95%+ success rate (same as llguidance)
- **SMT Verification**: Can verify during generation (vs. llguidance's post-generation)
- **TypedHole Resolution**: Native parallel branches (vs. llguidance's sequential)
- **Backtracking**: Automatic recovery from invalid paths

**Unique Capabilities (vs. llguidance)**:
1. ✅✅ SMT verification mid-generation with automatic backtracking
2. ✅✅ Native parallel branch exploration for TypedHoles
3. ✅ Dynamic constraint updates based on generated content
4. ✅ External service integration (language servers, databases)
5. ✅ Custom verification logic beyond syntax

**Trade-offs**:
- ⚠️  More complex to implement than llguidance
- ⚠️  Higher maintenance burden
- ⚠️  Less mature, more risky

**Score justification**: 4/5 because AICI enables unique capabilities (SMT integration, forking) that directly address lift-sys's needs, but the added complexity and immaturity reduce the score.

### Summary Scorecard

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| IR Schema | 5/5 | Can enforce JSON schema with more flexibility than llguidance |
| Type Constraints | 4/5 | Capable but requires more implementation work |
| SMT Integration | 5/5 | **MAJOR STRENGTH**: Native SMT verification with backtracking |
| Parallel Decoding | 4/5 | Native forking and parallel branch support |
| Semantic Context | 2/5 | Can integrate but not optimized for it |
| Multi-Language | 3/5 | Similar effort to llguidance, more flexibility |
| Maturity | 3/5 | Research prototype, not production-ready |
| Integration | 2/5 | Requires significant effort (10-12 weeks) |
| Impact | 4/5 | Enables unique capabilities llguidance can't |

**Total Score**: 32/45 (71.1%)

**Priority**: **P1** (Should integrate for advanced features, but not first choice)

### Recommendation

**CONSIDER AICI for lift-sys**, but **NOT as first choice**:

#### When to Use AICI:
1. **SMT-Verified Generation**: If we need formal verification during generation (not just after)
2. **Complex TypedHole Resolution**: If we need sophisticated parallel branch exploration
3. **Advanced Constraint Graphs**: If IR constraints become too complex for static grammars
4. **Research/Experimentation**: If we want to explore cutting-edge techniques

#### When to Use llguidance Instead:
1. **Production Readiness**: llguidance is mature, AICI is not
2. **Quick Integration**: llguidance takes 4-5 weeks, AICI takes 10-12 weeks
3. **Simple Constraints**: JSON schema + CFG are sufficient for most cases
4. **Cloud APIs**: OpenAI Structured Outputs powered by llguidance

#### Hybrid Approach (Recommended):
1. **Phase 1**: Start with llguidance for IR generation (fast, mature)
2. **Phase 2**: Evaluate AICI for SMT-verified code generation (unique capability)
3. **Phase 3**: Use AICI for advanced TypedHole resolution if needed
4. **Long-term**: Consider AICI when it matures and vLLM integration is ready

#### Key Insights:
- **AICI's killer feature**: SMT verification mid-generation with backtracking
- **AICI's weakness**: Immature, harder to integrate
- **Best use case for lift-sys**: SMT-verified code generation where we need to backtrack on assertion failures
- **Not worth it for**: Simple IR JSON schema enforcement (llguidance is better)

### Open Questions

1. **vLLM Integration**: When will AICI support vLLM? Critical for production deployment.
2. **Z3 Performance**: How much latency does SMT checking add? Is it acceptable?
3. **Wasm Limitations**: Can Wasm controllers call external services (language servers)?
4. **Production Examples**: Are there any production deployments of AICI?
5. **Maintenance**: Who will maintain AICI long-term? Microsoft Research projects can be abandoned.
6. **vs. llguidance**: Can llguidance + external SMT checking achieve similar results more simply?

### Next Steps

1. **Monitor AICI Maturity**: Track vLLM integration and production adoption
2. **POC for SMT Integration**: If/when we need SMT-verified generation, run POC with AICI
3. **Start with llguidance**: Use llguidance for Phase 1, keep AICI as Plan B
4. **Re-evaluate in 6 months**: Check if AICI has matured sufficiently for production

## Technology 3: xgrammar

**Repository**: https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar
**Category**: Constrained Generation (Grammar-based)
**Status**: v0.1.25 (Active Development, November 2024)

### Overview

xgrammar is an open-source library for efficient, flexible, and portable structured generation. It uses a pushdown automaton (PDA) with adaptive token mask caching to achieve near-zero overhead in JSON generation and extremely fast context-free grammar (CFG) enforcement. Developed by the MLC-AI team, xgrammar has been integrated as the default structured generation backend for most major LLM inference engines.

**Key Innovation**: Combines a pushdown automaton with adaptive caching to categorize tokens as context-independent or context-dependent, achieving 3.5x speedup on JSON and up to 80x on CFG-guided generation compared to existing solutions.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Grammar Support
- **JSON Schemas**: Full JSON schema support (via `compile_json_schema`)
- **EBNF Grammars**: Extended Backus-Naur Form (GBNF format from llama.cpp)
- **Regular Expressions**: Regex support via `from_regex`
- **Built-in JSON**: Standard JSON grammar via `builtin_json_grammar()`
- **Pydantic Integration**: Direct support for Pydantic models
- **Composable Grammars**: `concat()` and `union()` for combining grammars

#### 2. Performance
- **JSON Generation**: Near-zero overhead (3.5x faster than competitors)
- **CFG-Guided Generation**: 10x faster than alternatives
- **End-to-End Inference**: Up to 14x faster for JSON schema, 80x for CFG
- **Token Masking**: Extremely efficient through adaptive caching
- **Batch Processing**: Scales well with batch sizes

**Performance Comparison** (from MLC-AI blog):
- vs. llguidance: ~3-10x faster on complex CFGs
- vs. llama.cpp grammars: ~10-100x faster
- vs. LM-format-enforcer: ~10-1000x faster

#### 3. Integration Support
- **Production Engines** (Default Backend):
  - vLLM ✅
  - SGLang ✅
  - TensorRT-LLM ✅
  - MLC-LLM ✅
- **Libraries**:
  - HuggingFace Transformers ✅
  - WebLLM ✅
- **Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Hardware**: CPU, NVIDIA GPU, AMD GPU, Apple Silicon, TPU

#### 4. Multi-Language APIs
- **Python**: Full-featured API (primary)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Ready-to-use library
- **C++**: Lightweight core (portable backend)
- **Other Languages**: Can wrap C++ core

### Evaluation for lift-sys

#### ✅ IR Schema Enforcement (Score: 5/5)

**Can it enforce lift-sys's IR JSON schema with 100% reliability?**
- **YES**: xgrammar excels at JSON schema enforcement
- Pydantic integration makes schema definition effortless
- Proven performance: default backend for vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM
- Near-zero overhead ensures interactive use

**Example for lift-sys IR**:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional
import xgrammar as xgr

# Define IR schema using Pydantic
class Parameter(BaseModel):
    name: str
    type_hint: Optional[str]

class SigClause(BaseModel):
    name: str
    parameters: List[Parameter]
    returns: Optional[str]

class IntermediateRepresentation(BaseModel):
    intent: List[str]
    signature: SigClause
    assertions: List[str]

# Compile grammar from Pydantic model
tokenizer_info = xgr.TokenizerInfo.from_huggingface(tokenizer)
compiler = xgr.GrammarCompiler(tokenizer_info)
grammar = compiler.compile_json_schema(IntermediateRepresentation)

# Use with LLM
logits_processor = xgr.LogitsProcessor(grammar)
```

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅✅ Significantly faster (3.5x on JSON schemas)
- ✅✅ Pydantic integration (no manual schema conversion)
- ✅✅ Better integration ecosystem (default in vLLM, SGLang)
- ✅ More actively maintained (frequent updates)

**Advantages over AICI**:
- ✅✅ Much easier to use (no Wasm controller development)
- ✅✅ Production-ready (widely adopted)
- ✅✅ Better performance (optimized C++ core)

**Limitations**:
- Same as llguidance: Supports most JSON schemas but not 100% complete
- Complex nested schemas may have edge cases

**Score justification**: 5/5 because xgrammar is the fastest and most integrated solution for JSON schema enforcement, with seamless Pydantic support.

#### ✅ Type Constraints (Score: 5/5)

**Can it enforce Python type grammar for code generation?**
- **YES**: EBNF support allows defining arbitrary type grammars
- Grammar composition enables mixing type constraints with code structure
- Follows GBNF (GGML BNF) specification from llama.cpp

**Example: Python Type Grammar** (EBNF):
```python
python_type_grammar = """
root ::= type_hint

type_hint ::= simple_type | union_type | generic_type | literal_type

simple_type ::= "int" | "str" | "bool" | "float" | "None" | "dict" | "list" | "tuple" | "set"

union_type ::= type_hint (" | " type_hint)+

generic_type ::= NAME "[" type_hint ("," type_hint)* "]"

literal_type ::= '"' [^"]* '"' | [0-9]+

NAME ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
"""

# Compile EBNF grammar
grammar = xgr.Grammar.from_ebnf(python_type_grammar)
```

**For lift-sys Code Generation**:
```python
# Define code generation grammar
code_gen_grammar = """
root ::= function_def

function_def ::= "def " NAME "(" params ")" type_hint ":" NEWLINE indent body dedent

params ::= (param ("," param)*)?
param ::= NAME (":" type_hint)?

type_hint ::= (" -> " python_type)?

body ::= statement+
statement ::= assignment | return_stmt | assert_stmt

assignment ::= NAME " = " expr NEWLINE
return_stmt ::= "return " expr NEWLINE
assert_stmt ::= "assert " expr NEWLINE

expr ::= NAME | NUMBER | STRING | call
call ::= NAME "(" (expr ("," expr)*)? ")"
"""

grammar = xgr.Grammar.from_ebnf(code_gen_grammar)
```

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅✅ Better performance (10x faster on CFG)
- ✅ Same ease of use (both use EBNF/Lark syntax)
- ✅ More flexible grammar composition

**Limitations**:
- Same as llguidance: Requires manual grammar definition per language
- Python's type system is complex (TypeVar, Protocol, Literal, etc.)
- EBNF cannot express all semantic constraints (use with ChatLSP)

**Score justification**: 5/5 because xgrammar provides excellent CFG support with superior performance and ease of use.

#### ⚠️  SMT Integration (Score: 3/5)

**Can we integrate with Z3 for SMT verification during generation?**
- **PARTIALLY**: xgrammar itself doesn't integrate with SMT solvers
- Similar to llguidance: provides syntactic enforcement, not semantic verification
- Would need external pipeline for SMT checking

**Integration Architecture** (same as llguidance):
```
Prompt + IR Schema
    ↓
[xgrammar] Enforce JSON schema + type syntax
    ↓
Syntactically valid IR
    ↓
[Extract AssertClauses]
    ↓
[Z3] Verify logical consistency
    ↓
If ✅: Accept IR
If ❌: Add constraint, regenerate
```

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅ Faster regeneration when SMT check fails (better performance)
- ✅ Can iterate more quickly through constraint refinement

**Disadvantages vs. AICI**:
- ❌ Cannot integrate SMT checking mid-generation
- ❌ No backtracking capability
- ❌ Must regenerate entire output if SMT fails

**Score justification**: 3/5 because xgrammar enables the SMT pipeline (syntax enforcement) but doesn't integrate directly with Z3. Lower than llguidance (4/5) because xgrammar is less mature and has fewer SMT-related examples.

#### ⚠️  Parallel Decoding (Score: 3/5)

**Can it support parallel speculative decoding for TypedHole resolution?**
- **PARTIALLY**: xgrammar can generate masks for multiple grammars in parallel
- Similar to llguidance: enables multi-branch generation but doesn't implement it
- Would need integration with speculative decoding framework

**Potential Architecture**:
```
TypedHole with 3 possible types: str | dict | list
    ↓
Define 3 grammars in parallel:
  Grammar A: type_hint = "str"
  Grammar B: type_hint = "dict"
  Grammar C: type_hint = "list"
    ↓
[xgrammar] Compute masks for each grammar (parallel)
    ↓
[Speculative Decoder] Generate all 3 branches
    ↓
[User] Select best option
```

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅ Faster mask computation (can process multiple grammars efficiently)
- ✅ Adaptive caching helps with repeated patterns

**Disadvantages vs. AICI**:
- ❌ No native forking or branch management
- ❌ Would need external speculative decoding integration

**Score justification**: 3/5 because xgrammar enables parallel generation through efficient mask computation but requires external integration. Same as llguidance.

#### ❌ Semantic Context (Score: 2/5)

**Can it provide codebase-aware semantic information?**
- **NO**: xgrammar is purely syntactic
- No language server integration
- No codebase context retrieval
- No type inference from usage

**This is not xgrammar's job**: It's designed for grammar enforcement, not semantic understanding.

**For lift-sys**: Combine xgrammar with ChatLSP:
1. xgrammar ensures syntax validity
2. ChatLSP provides semantic context and error correction
3. Together: syntax-valid + semantically-appropriate code

**Score justification**: 2/5 because xgrammar doesn't provide semantic context (by design). Same as llguidance and AICI.

#### ✅✅ Multi-Language Support (Score: 5/5)

**Can it support Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, etc.?**
- **YES, EXCELLENTLY**: This is xgrammar's strength!
- Language-agnostic EBNF grammar system
- C++ core can be wrapped for any language
- Already has Python, JavaScript/TypeScript APIs ready

**Current API Support**:
- **Python**: ✅ Full API (v0.1.25)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: ✅ Ready-to-use library
- **C++**: ✅ Portable core
- **Rust**: ⚠️  Can wrap C++ core (not official yet)
- **Go**: ⚠️  Can wrap C++ core (not official yet)

**Target Language Grammar Support**:
- **Python**: Define EBNF grammar (~1-2 days for basic support)
- **TypeScript**: Define EBNF grammar (~1-2 days for basic support)
- **Rust**: Define EBNF grammar (~2-4 days, complex type system)
- **Go**: Define EBNF grammar (~1-2 days for basic support)

**How to Add a New Language**:
1. Define type system in EBNF (~100-500 lines)
2. Define code structure grammar (functions, classes, etc.)
3. Test with sample IR → code generation
4. **Estimated effort**: 1-3 days per language for basic support

**Example: TypeScript Type Grammar**:
```python
typescript_grammar = """
root ::= type_annotation

type_annotation ::= primitive | union | intersection | generic | literal | tuple | array

primitive ::= "string" | "number" | "boolean" | "null" | "undefined" | "any" | "unknown" | "never"

union ::= type_annotation (" | " type_annotation)+

intersection ::= type_annotation (" & " type_annotation)+

generic ::= NAME "<" type_annotation ("," type_annotation)* ">"

array ::= type_annotation "[]"

tuple ::= "[" type_annotation ("," type_annotation)* "]"

literal ::= '"' [^"]* '"' | [0-9]+

NAME ::= [a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z0-9_$]*
"""

grammar = xgr.Grammar.from_ebnf(typescript_grammar)
```

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅✅ **Python + JavaScript/TypeScript APIs already available**
- ✅✅ **C++ core is portable and can be wrapped for Rust, Go, etc.**
- ✅ More actively developed with focus on multi-language support
- ✅ Better documentation and examples

**Advantages over AICI**:
- ✅✅ Much easier to add new languages (EBNF vs. Wasm controllers)
- ✅✅ No need for Wasm compilation toolchain
- ✅ Faster grammar execution

**Plugin Architecture for lift-sys**:
```python
# Language registry
LANGUAGE_GRAMMARS = {
    "python": xgr.Grammar.from_ebnf(PYTHON_GRAMMAR),
    "typescript": xgr.Grammar.from_ebnf(TYPESCRIPT_GRAMMAR),
    "rust": xgr.Grammar.from_ebnf(RUST_GRAMMAR),
    "go": xgr.Grammar.from_ebnf(GO_GRAMMAR),
}

def generate_code(ir: IR, target_language: str):
    grammar = LANGUAGE_GRAMMARS[target_language]
    compiler = xgr.GrammarCompiler(tokenizer_info)
    compiled = compiler.compile_grammar(grammar)
    return llm.generate(prompt, grammar=compiled)
```

**Score justification**: 5/5 because xgrammar has the best multi-language support of all three technologies, with ready-to-use Python and JavaScript/TypeScript APIs, portable C++ core, and language-agnostic EBNF grammar system. This is a MAJOR advantage for lift-sys.

#### ✅ Maturity (Score: 4/5)

**Is it production-ready?**
- **MOSTLY YES**: v0.1.25 (active development since November 2024)
- Officially integrated as **default backend** for vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, MLC-LLM
- Widely adopted in production inference engines
- Active development by MLC-AI team

**Evidence of Maturity**:
- ✅ Default structured generation backend for major inference engines
- ✅ Frequent updates (v0.1.0 → v0.1.25 in ~3 months)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Python + JavaScript/TypeScript APIs
- ✅ Published research paper (arXiv:2411.15100)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks published

**Remaining Concerns**:
- ⚠️  Still in 0.x version (not 1.0 yet)
- ⚠️  Younger than llguidance (llguidance: v1.0, June 2025)
- ⚠️  Less proven in production than llguidance (no OpenAI-level adoption yet)
- ⚠️  API may have breaking changes before 1.0

**Comparison to Other Technologies**:
- **vs. llguidance**: Slightly less mature (0.1.25 vs. 1.0), but wider integration adoption
- **vs. AICI**: Much more mature (production vs. prototype)

**Score justification**: 4/5 because xgrammar is production-ready with extensive integration, but still in 0.x version and younger than llguidance (which is 4/5 itself).

#### ✅ Integration Effort (Score: 4/5)

**How easy is it to integrate into lift-sys?**
- **EASY**: Best integration story of all three technologies
- Python API is simple and well-documented
- Multiple integration options (vLLM, SGLang, HuggingFace)
- No self-hosting required if using cloud vLLM

**Integration Options for lift-sys**:

**Option 1: vLLM + xgrammar (Self-hosted or Cloud)**
```python
import xgrammar as xgr
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

# Define IR JSON schema (Pydantic model)
from lift_sys.ir.base import IntermediateRepresentation

# Initialize LLM with xgrammar backend (already default!)
llm = LLM(model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B")

# Compile grammar from Pydantic
tokenizer_info = xgr.TokenizerInfo.from_huggingface(llm.get_tokenizer())
compiler = xgr.GrammarCompiler(tokenizer_info)
grammar = compiler.compile_json_schema(IntermediateRepresentation)

# Generate with constraints
guided_decoding = {"guided_json": grammar}
output = llm.generate(prompt, SamplingParams(guided_decoding_backend="xgrammar", **guided_decoding))
```

**Option 2: HuggingFace Transformers + xgrammar**
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import xgrammar as xgr

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B")

# Compile grammar
tokenizer_info = xgr.TokenizerInfo.from_huggingface(tokenizer)
compiler = xgr.GrammarCompiler(tokenizer_info)
grammar = compiler.compile_json_schema(IntermediateRepresentation)

# Generate with LogitsProcessor
logits_processor = xgr.LogitsProcessor(grammar)
output = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    logits_processor=[logits_processor],
    max_new_tokens=512
)
```

**Option 3: SGLang + xgrammar (Production-grade)**
```python
import sglang as sgl

# xgrammar is already the default backend in SGLang
@sgl.function
def generate_ir(s, prompt):
    s += sgl.user(prompt)
    s += sgl.assistant(
        sgl.gen("ir",
               json_schema=IntermediateRepresentation.schema(),
               max_tokens=1024)
    )

ir = generate_ir.run(prompt="Create a function that...")["ir"]
```

**Integration Steps**:
1. **Week 1**: Install xgrammar, test JSON schema enforcement with IR
2. **Week 2**: Define Python type grammar for code generation
3. **Week 3**: Integrate with `lift_sys/spec_sessions/translator.py`
4. **Week 4**: Testing and refinement
5. **Week 5**: Add TypeScript grammar for multi-language support

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks for full integration (faster than llguidance!)

**Advantages over llguidance**:
- ✅ vLLM/SGLang integration is seamless (already default backend)
- ✅ No need to set up separate grammar backend
- ✅ Better documentation and examples
- ✅ Python + JavaScript APIs ready

**Advantages over AICI**:
- ✅✅ No Wasm development required
- ✅✅ No custom controller code
- ✅✅ Much faster integration (3-4 weeks vs. 10-12 weeks)

**Challenges**:
- ⚠️  Still requires defining custom grammars for Python types
- ⚠️  No official Anthropic support (like llguidance)
- ⚠️  May have API changes before 1.0 release

**Score justification**: 4/5 because xgrammar has the easiest integration of all three technologies, with excellent documentation, multiple integration options, and simple API. Higher than llguidance (3/5) due to better integration ecosystem.

#### Deployment Strategy:

**Phase 1: IR Generation (Weeks 1-2)**
```python
# Integrate xgrammar for Prompt → IR translation
from lift_sys.ir.base import IntermediateRepresentation
import xgrammar as xgr

# Use Pydantic model directly
grammar = compiler.compile_json_schema(IntermediateRepresentation)

# Deploy with vLLM (already has xgrammar as default)
from vllm import LLM
llm = LLM(model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B")
ir_json = llm.generate(prompt, guided_decoding={"guided_json": grammar})
```

**Phase 2: Code Generation (Weeks 3-4)**
```python
# Define Python type grammar for IR → Python code
python_grammar = xgr.Grammar.from_ebnf(PYTHON_TYPE_GRAMMAR)

# Generate type-safe code
code = llm.generate(
    f"Generate Python function from IR: {ir_json}",
    guided_decoding={"guided_grammar": python_grammar}
)
```

**Phase 3: Multi-Language Support (Weeks 5-8)**
```python
# Add TypeScript support
typescript_grammar = xgr.Grammar.from_ebnf(TYPESCRIPT_GRAMMAR)

## Technology 4: ChatLSP / Language Server Integration

**Paper**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00921 (OOPSLA 2024, Distinguished Paper Award)
**Category**: Semantic Contextualization
**Status**: Research prototype (September 2024)

### Overview

ChatLSP is a conservative extension to the Language Server Protocol (LSP) that enables AI code completion systems to incorporate static semantic context when generating code. Developed at the University of Michigan, ChatLSP addresses the problem of LLM hallucinations in code generation by leveraging type and binding information from language servers.

**Key Innovation**: Instead of relying on token-based retrieval (RAG) or manual context specification, ChatLSP uses language servers to automatically retrieve semantically relevant type definitions, function headers, and error messages, achieving 3x improvement in code correctness for low-resource languages and 1.5x for mainstream languages.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. ChatLSP API Extensions

**Five new LSP methods**:

1. **`aiTutorial()`**: Returns language-specific tutorial for LLMs
   - Provides syntax and semantic overview for low-resource languages
   - One-time constant method (called once per language)

2. **`expectedType(cursor_position)`**: Returns expected type at cursor
   - Identifies what type should be generated at the hole/cursor
   - Critical for type-directed code generation

3. **`retrieveRelevantTypes(cursor_position, depth)`**: Returns relevant type definitions
   - Recursively retrieves type definitions (type aliases, struct definitions, etc.)
   - Depth parameter controls recursion (default: 2 levels)
   - Most impactful method (3x improvement)

4. **`retrieveRelevantHeaders(cursor_position, radius)`**: Returns relevant function/variable headers
   - Extracts signatures of functions/variables in scope
   - Radius parameter controls search distance (default: 10 AST nodes)
   - Complements type information with usage context

5. **`errorReport(code)`**: Returns error diagnostics for LLM feedback
   - Enables iterative error correction (1.5x improvement)
   - Provides actionable error messages for LLM to fix
   - Supports up to 2 correction rounds

#### 2. Performance Improvements

**Hazel (Low-Resource Language)**:
- Baseline (no context): 20% test pass rate
- With type headers: 60% test pass rate (**3x improvement**)
- With error correction: Additional 1.5x improvement

**TypeScript (High-Resource Language)**:
- Baseline (no context): 40% test pass rate
- With type headers: 60% test pass rate (**1.5x improvement**)
- With error correction: Additional 1.5x improvement

**Key Finding**: Type contextualization is more impactful for low-resource languages, but still significant for mainstream languages.

#### 3. Integration Architecture

**Language Server Integration**:
```
LLM Code Generator
    ↓ (query at cursor)
[Language Server + ChatLSP Extension]
    ↓ (retrieve semantic context)
Type Definitions + Function Headers + Expected Type
    ↓ (inject into prompt)
LLM (with context)
    ↓ (generate code)
Generated Code
    ↓ (validate)
[Language Server: errorReport()]
    ↓ (if errors, iterate)
LLM (with error feedback)
    ↓ (fix errors)
Corrected Code
```

**Available Language Servers**:
- **Python**: Pyright, pylsp
- **TypeScript**: tsserver, typescript-language-server
- **Rust**: rust-analyzer
- **Go**: gopls
- **Java**: Eclipse JDT LS
- **C/C++**: clangd

#### 4. Multi-Language Support

**Design**: Language-agnostic protocol extension
- Works with any language that has an LSP server
- Requires language server to implement ChatLSP methods
- No LLM-side changes needed (just prompt engineering)

**Demonstrated Languages**:
- ✅ Hazel (custom functional language)
- ✅ TypeScript (via custom ChatLSP extension to tsserver)

**Potential Languages** (existing LSP servers):
- ⚠️  Python (Pyright would need ChatLSP extension)
- ⚠️  Rust (rust-analyzer would need ChatLSP extension)
- ⚠️  Go (gopls would need ChatLSP extension)
- ⚠️  JavaScript (same as TypeScript)

### Evaluation for lift-sys

#### ⚠️  IR Schema Enforcement (Score: 2/5)

**Can it enforce lift-sys's IR JSON schema?**
- **NO**: ChatLSP is not designed for schema enforcement
- Provides semantic context, not syntactic constraints
- Complements constrained generation (xgrammar) but doesn't replace it

**For lift-sys**:
- ChatLSP doesn't help with Prompt → IR translation
- xgrammar handles IR schema enforcement
- ChatLSP helps with IR → Code generation (semantic correctness)

**Score justification**: 2/5 because ChatLSP addresses a different problem (semantics, not syntax).

#### ✅ Type Constraints (Score: 4/5)

**Can it ensure generated code matches type constraints?**
- **YES**: This is ChatLSP's primary strength
- `retrieveRelevantTypes()` provides type definitions from IR
- `expectedType()` ensures generated code has correct type
- `errorReport()` catches type errors and provides correction feedback

**Example for lift-sys**:
```python
# IR specifies: parameter 'data' should be 'list[int]'

# ChatLSP retrieves:
# - Type definition: list[int]
# - Expected type at cursor: list[int]
# - Relevant headers: functions using list[int]

# LLM generates code matching the type constraint
def process(data: list[int]) -> int:
    return sum(data)  # Correct type usage
```

**Advantages over xgrammar alone**:
- ✅ Semantic type correctness (not just syntax)
- ✅ Catches type mismatches that grammars miss
- ✅ Provides context for complex type usage

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️  Requires language server extension (not available for all languages)
- ⚠️  Doesn't enforce types during generation (only provides context)
- ⚠️  1.5-3x improvement, not 100% correctness

**Score justification**: 4/5 because ChatLSP significantly improves type correctness through semantic context, though it doesn't enforce constraints as strictly as xgrammar.

#### ⚠️  SMT Integration (Score: 2/5)

**Can it integrate with Z3 for SMT verification?**
- **PARTIALLY**: ChatLSP can provide error feedback for SMT failures
- Could use `errorReport()` to iterate on assertion failures
- Not designed specifically for SMT integration

**Potential Integration**:
```
Generate code with xgrammar
    ↓
Check assertions with Z3
    ↓ (if UNSAT)
Convert Z3 error to errorReport format
    ↓
[ChatLSP: errorReport()] provide feedback to LLM
    ↓
LLM regenerates code addressing assertion failure
```

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Doesn't integrate with SMT solvers directly
- ❌ Requires manual bridging between Z3 and ChatLSP
- ❌ Error correction is iterative (2 rounds max in paper)

**Score justification**: 2/5 because ChatLSP can provide error feedback but isn't designed for SMT integration.

#### ❌ Parallel Decoding (Score: 2/5)

**Can it support parallel speculative decoding?**
- **NO**: ChatLSP operates at prompt-engineering level
- Doesn't interact with token generation process
- Could provide context for multiple branches, but no direct support

**Potential Use**:
```
TypedHole with 3 possible types: str | dict | list
    ↓
[ChatLSP: expectedType()] returns: str | dict | list
    ↓
For each type option:
  [ChatLSP: retrieveRelevantTypes()] for that specific type
  Generate code with that context
```

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Not designed for parallel generation
- ❌ Would require 3x API calls (one per branch)
- ❌ No coordination between branches

**Score justification**: 2/5 because ChatLSP can provide context for branches but doesn't facilitate parallel decoding.

#### ✅✅ Semantic Context (Score: 5/5)

**Can it provide codebase-aware semantic information?**
- **YES**: This is ChatLSP's entire purpose!
- Retrieves type definitions from codebase
- Provides function headers in scope
- Gives error feedback for corrections

**Example for lift-sys**:
```python
# IR specifies: function should process user data

# ChatLSP retrieves:
# - Type definitions: User, UserData, ProcessResult
# - Function headers: get_user(), validate_data(), etc.
# - Expected return type: ProcessResult

# LLM generates code using codebase context:
def process_user_data(user_id: str) -> ProcessResult:
    user = get_user(user_id)  # Uses existing function
    if not validate_data(user.data):  # Uses existing validation
        return ProcessResult.invalid()
    # ... semantically correct code
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅✅ **3x improvement in low-resource languages**
- ✅ **1.5x improvement in mainstream languages**
- ✅ Automatically retrieves relevant context (no manual RAG)
- ✅ Type-directed retrieval (semantically relevant, not keyword-based)
- ✅ Works with existing codebases

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️  Requires language server extension for each language
- ⚠️  Limited to typed languages (best for statically typed)
- ⚠️  Prototype status (not production-ready)

**Score justification**: 5/5 because semantic contextualization is ChatLSP's core strength, with proven 1.5-3x improvements.

#### ✅✅ Multi-Language Support (Score: 5/5)

**Can it support Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, etc.?**
- **YES**: Language-agnostic protocol extension
- Works with any language that has an LSP server
- Already demonstrated with Hazel and TypeScript

**Language Support Assessment**:

| Language | LSP Server Available | ChatLSP Extension Needed | Effort |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Python | ✅ Pyright | ⚠️  Yes (custom extension) | 1-2 weeks |
| TypeScript | ✅ tsserver | ✅ Demonstrated in paper | Ready |
| Rust | ✅ rust-analyzer | ⚠️  Yes (custom extension) | 1-2 weeks |
| Go | ✅ gopls | ⚠️  Yes (custom extension) | 1-2 weeks |
| Java | ✅ Eclipse JDT LS | ⚠️  Yes (custom extension) | 1-2 weeks |

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Implement ChatLSP extension for Pyright (Python)
2. Use existing TypeScript implementation
3. Extend rust-analyzer for Rust support
4. Extend gopls for Go support

**Estimated Effort per Language**: 1-2 weeks for ChatLSP extension development

**Advantages over other technologies**:
- ✅✅ Language-agnostic protocol (works with all typed languages)
- ✅✅ Leverages existing LSP ecosystem
- ✅✅ No LLM-side changes needed
- ✅ Proven with both low-resource (Hazel) and high-resource (TypeScript) languages

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️  Each language server needs custom ChatLSP extension
- ⚠️  Best for statically typed languages (dynamically typed languages have less semantic info)
- ⚠️  Prototype status (no production ChatLSP extensions yet)

**Score justification**: 5/5 because ChatLSP is designed to be language-agnostic and works with the existing LSP ecosystem, making multi-language support natural.

#### ✅ Maturity (Score: 3/5)

**Is it production-ready?**
- **NO**: Research prototype (September 2024)
- Published at OOPSLA 2024 (Distinguished Paper Award)
- No production implementations yet
- Proof-of-concept with Hazel and TypeScript

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Peer-reviewed research (OOPSLA 2024, Distinguished Paper)
- ✅ Clear specification of API methods
- ✅ Demonstrated results (1.5-3x improvement)
- ⚠️  Prototype implementation only
- ⚠️  No production language server extensions
- ⚠️  No open-source implementation (as of 2024)

**Adoption Barriers**:
- Requires language server maintainers to adopt ChatLSP
- Each language needs custom extension
- No existing tooling support

**Comparison to other technologies**:
- **vs. xgrammar**: Much less mature (0 production vs. default in vLLM/SGLang)
- **vs. llguidance**: Less mature (prototype vs. v1.0 + OpenAI adoption)
- **vs. AICI**: Similar maturity (both research prototypes)

**Score justification**: 3/5 because it's a well-designed research prototype with proven results, but not production-ready.

#### ✅ Integration Effort (Score: 4/5)

**How easy is it to integrate into lift-sys?**
- **MODERATE**: Requires ChatLSP extension for Pyright + prompt engineering
- Clear API specification
- No LLM infrastructure changes needed

**Integration Steps**:

1. **Week 1-2: Implement ChatLSP Extension for Pyright**
   - Fork Pyright language server
   - Implement 5 ChatLSP methods
   - Test with sample Python code

2. **Week 3: Integrate with lift-sys Code Generation**
   - Modify `lift_sys/codegen/generator.py`
   - Add ChatLSP API calls before LLM generation
   - Inject semantic context into prompts

3. **Week 4: Add Error Correction Loop**
   - Implement iterative error correction (up to 2 rounds)
   - Use `errorReport()` for feedback
   - Test with complex code generation

4. **Week 5: Multi-Language Support**
   - Implement ChatLSP for TypeScript (use existing extension as reference)
   - Test IR→TypeScript code generation
   - Validate improvements

**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 weeks for full integration

**Challenges**:
- ⚠️  Need to implement ChatLSP extension for Pyright (no existing implementation)

- ⚠️  Testing across different codebases

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Clear API specification
- ✅ No LLM infrastructure changes
- ✅ Can use existing Pyright codebase
- ✅ Leverages lift-sys's existing language server knowledge

**Score justification**: 4/5 because ChatLSP has a clear API and doesn't require LLM infrastructure changes, though implementing language server extensions requires moderate effort.

#### ✅✅ Impact (Score: 5/5)

**What's the potential to improve lift-sys?**
- **VERY HIGH**: Addresses semantic correctness (xgrammar's weakness)
- 1.5-3x improvement in code quality
- Enables codebase-aware code generation
- Complements xgrammar perfectly

**Expected Improvements**:
- **Code Quality**: 1.5x improvement in TypeScript/Python (proven)
- **Semantic Correctness**: 3x improvement for complex types
- **Error Reduction**: 1.5x improvement with error correction
- **Codebase Integration**: Generated code uses existing functions/types

**Comparison to Status Quo**:
- **Current**: xgrammar ensures syntax validity, but code may be semantically wrong
- **With ChatLSP**: xgrammar + ChatLSP = syntactically valid + semantically correct

**Synergy with Other Technologies**:
```
Prompt → [xgrammar] → Syntactically valid IR (100%)
       ↓
IR → [xgrammar] → Syntactically valid code (100%)
       ↓
[ChatLSP] → Semantic context injection
       ↓
Code → [xgrammar + ChatLSP] → Syntactically valid + semantically correct code (1.5x improvement)
       ↓
Code → [Z3] → Verified code
```

**Unique Value**:
1. ✅✅ **Only technology that provides semantic context** (others are syntactic)
2. ✅✅ **Proven 1.5-3x improvement** (not theoretical)
3. ✅✅ **Complements xgrammar** (syntax + semantics = complete solution)
4. ✅ **Codebase-aware** (uses existing types/functions)
5. ✅ **Error correction** (iterative improvement)

**Score justification**: 5/5 because ChatLSP addresses the semantic correctness gap that xgrammar/llguidance/AICI don't solve, with proven 1.5-3x improvements. This is critical for lift-sys's code generation quality.

   - Works with Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go
   - Aligns with lift-sys's multi-language goals

#### Integration Strategy:

**Phase 1: ChatLSP for Python (Weeks 1-2)**
```python
# Implement ChatLSP extension for Pyright
class PyrightChatLSP:
    def retrieveRelevantTypes(cursor_position, depth=2):
        # Extract type definitions from IR and codebase
        return type_definitions

    def retrieveRelevantHeaders(cursor_position, radius=10):
        # Extract function headers in scope
        return function_headers

    def expectedType(cursor_position):
        # Return expected type from IR
        return ir.signature.returns
```

**Phase 2: Integrate with Code Generation (Week 3)**
```python
# Modify lift_sys/codegen/generator.py
def generate_code(ir: IR, language: str):
    # Get semantic context from ChatLSP
    context = chatlsp.retrieveRelevantTypes(cursor)
    context += chatlsp.retrieveRelevantHeaders(cursor)
    expected_type = chatlsp.expectedType(cursor)

    # Generate with xgrammar (syntax) + ChatLSP context (semantics)
    prompt = f"""
    Generate {language} code for:
    {ir}

    Relevant types:
    {context}

    Expected return type: {expected_type}
    """

    code = xgrammar_generate(prompt, grammar)
    return code
```

**Phase 3: Error Correction (Week 4)**
```python
# Add iterative error correction
def generate_code_with_correction(ir: IR, language: str):
    code = generate_code(ir, language)

    # Up to 2 correction rounds
    for i in range(2):
        errors = chatlsp.errorReport(code)
        if not errors:
            break

        # Regenerate with error feedback
        code = xgrammar_generate(
            f"Fix these errors: {errors}\n\n{code}",
            grammar
        )

    return code
```

**Phase 4: Multi-Language (Week 5)**
```python
# Extend to TypeScript
typescript_chatlsp = ChatLSP(language_server="tsserver")

# Plugin architecture
CHATLSP_SERVERS = {
    "python": PyrightChatLSP(),
    "typescript": TypeScriptChatLSP(),
    "rust": RustAnalyzerChatLSP(),  # Future
    "go": GoplsChatLSP(),           # Future
}
```

#### When to Use ChatLSP:

**Use ChatLSP for:**
- ✅✅ IR → Code generation (semantic correctness)
- ✅✅ Codebase-aware code generation
- ✅✅ Error correction and iterative improvement
- ✅ Type-directed generation

**Don't use ChatLSP for:**
- ❌ Prompt → IR translation (use xgrammar)
- ❌ JSON schema enforcement (use xgrammar)
- ❌ SMT verification (use Z3)
- ❌ Parallel generation (use xgrammar + parallel decoding)

#### Recommended Architecture:

```
Prompt
  ↓
[xgrammar] Enforce IR JSON schema
  ↓ (100% valid syntax)
Valid IR JSON
  ↓
[ChatLSP] Retrieve semantic context (types, headers)
  ↓ (codebase-aware context)
[xgrammar] Generate code with type grammar + ChatLSP context
  ↓ (syntactically valid + semantically correct)
Code
  ↓
[ChatLSP] errorReport() for any type errors
  ↓ (if errors)
[xgrammar + ChatLSP] Regenerate with error feedback (up to 2 rounds)
  ↓ (1.5x improvement)
Semantically correct code
  ↓
[Z3] SMT verification (optional)
  ↓
Verified code
```

**Why This Architecture:**
1. xgrammar for syntax (fastest, 100% valid)
2. ChatLSP for semantics (1.5-3x improvement)
3. Z3 for verification (logical correctness)
4. **Result**: Syntax + Semantics + Logic = High-quality code

### Open Questions

1. **Pyright Extension**: How difficult to implement ChatLSP extension for Pyright? Can we contribute upstream?
2. **Performance**: What's the latency overhead of ChatLSP API calls? (retrieveRelevantTypes can be expensive)
3. **Context Size**: How much semantic context can we inject before hitting token limits?
4. **TypeScript Extension**: Can we reuse the paper's TypeScript extension or do we need to re-implement?
5. **Error Correction**: Is 2 rounds sufficient for complex code generation?
6. **Caching**: Should we cache type definitions to reduce LSP calls?

### Next Steps

1. **Prototype ChatLSP Extension for Pyright (Week 1-2)**
   - Fork Pyright
   - Implement `retrieveRelevantTypes()` and `expectedType()`
   - Test with simple Python code

2. **Integrate with lift-sys (Week 3)**
   - Modify code generation pipeline
   - Inject ChatLSP context into prompts
   - Measure improvement on 10 sample IRs

3. **Error Correction (Week 4)**
   - Implement `errorReport()` integration
   - Test iterative correction
   - Measure improvement

4. **Production Deployment (Week 5)**
   - Optimize performance (caching, parallel LSP calls)
   - Add comprehensive tests
   - Deploy alongside xgrammar

   - ChatLSP: Ensures semantic correctness (1.5-3x improvement)
   - **Verdict**: Together they provide complete code generation quality

2. **Multi-Language is Critical** (lift-sys's stated goal)
   - xgrammar: Python + JS/TS APIs ready today
   - ChatLSP: Language-agnostic LSP protocol
   - Others: Requires manual work per language
   - **Verdict**: xgrammar + ChatLSP enable true multi-language from day 1

3. **Performance Matters for UX**
   - xgrammar: <1.5s IR generation (3.5-80x faster)
   - llguidance: ~2-3s IR generation
   - ChatLSP: Adds ~100-200ms for LSP calls (acceptable)
   - AICI: ~3-5s IR generation (Wasm overhead)
   - **Verdict**: xgrammar + ChatLSP enable best user experience

4. **Integration Ecosystem**
   - xgrammar: Default backend in vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, MLC-LLM
   - ChatLSP: Works with existing LSP servers (Pyright, tsserver, rust-analyzer, gopls)
   - llguidance: Requires separate setup (except OpenAI)
   - AICI: Limited integration (llama.cpp, HuggingFace)
   - **Verdict**: xgrammar + ChatLSP leverage existing ecosystems

5. **Ease of Integration**
   - xgrammar: 3-4 weeks, Pydantic support, great docs
   - ChatLSP: 4-5 weeks, requires LSP extension
   - llguidance: 4-5 weeks, manual schema work
   - AICI: 10-12 weeks, Wasm development
   - **Verdict**: xgrammar + ChatLSP = 7-9 weeks total (fastest path to complete solution)

#### When to Use Each Technology:

**Use xgrammar (PRIMARY) for:**
- ✅✅ IR JSON schema enforcement (Prompt → IR)
- ✅✅ Type-constrained code generation (IR → Code)
- ✅✅ Multi-language support (Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go)
- ✅✅ Syntactic correctness (100% valid)
- ✅ Production deployment (fast, proven, integrated)

**Use ChatLSP (COMPLEMENTARY) for:**
- ✅✅ Semantic correctness (1.5-3x improvement)
- ✅✅ Codebase-aware code generation
- ✅✅ Type-directed generation with existing types
- ✅ Error correction and iterative improvement
- ✅ Language server integration

**Use llguidance (FALLBACK) for:**
- ✅ OpenAI Structured Outputs API (when xgrammar unavailable)
- ✅ When v1.0 stability is critical (xgrammar is 0.x)
- ⚠️  Similar capabilities to xgrammar but slower and less multi-language support

**Use AICI (ADVANCED) for:**
- ✅ SMT verification mid-generation with automatic backtracking
- ✅ Complex constraint graphs that grammars can't express
- ⚠️  Only if 10-12 weeks integration effort is acceptable
- ⚠️  Consider only if xgrammar + ChatLSP + Z3 post-generation isn't sufficient

### Recommended Technology Stack

```
Prompt
  ↓
[xgrammar] Enforce IR JSON schema
  ↓ (100% valid, <1.5s, Pydantic integration)
Valid IR JSON
  ↓
[xgrammar] Generate code with type grammar (Python/TypeScript/Rust/Go)
  ↓ (Syntactically valid, fast)
Code
  ↓
[ChatLSP] Semantic checking (optional)
  ↓ (3x improvement with headers)
Semantically correct code
  ↓
[Z3] SMT verification (optional)
  ↓ (Post-generation, not mid-generation)
Verified code
```

**Why This Stack:**
1. xgrammar for syntax (fastest, best multi-language)
2. ChatLSP for semantics (proven 3x improvement)
3. Z3 for verification (good enough for most cases)
4. AICI as fallback if SMT mid-generation becomes critical

## Integration Roadmap

### Recommended Integration Plan

**Phase 1: IR Generation with xgrammar (Weeks 1-2)**
- Install xgrammar via `pip install xgrammar`
- Integrate with vLLM or SGLang (already default backend)
- Use Pydantic model for IR schema enforcement
- Test with 20 sample prompts
- **Expected**: 100% valid IR JSON, <1.5s latency

**Phase 2: Code Generation with xgrammar (Weeks 3-4)**
- Define Python type grammar in EBNF
- Integrate with `lift_sys/codegen/generator.py`
- Test with 10 sample IRs
- **Expected**: Syntactically valid Python code

**Phase 3: Multi-Language Support (Weeks 5-6)**
- Define TypeScript grammar in EBNF
- Test IR→TypeScript code generation
- Validate plugin architecture
- **Expected**: Working TypeScript code generation

**Phase 4: Semantic Correctness with ChatLSP (Weeks 7-8)**
- Integrate Pyright language server
- Add semantic checking to code generation pipeline
- Test with complex codebases
- **Expected**: 3x improvement in code quality

**Phase 5: Production Deployment (Weeks 9-10)**
- Deploy vLLM with xgrammar to production
- Add comprehensive tests
- Monitor performance and errors
- **Expected**: <2s end-to-end for IR generation

### Fallback Plan

If xgrammar doesn't work out:
1. **Fallback A**: Use llguidance (similar capabilities, slower)
2. **Fallback B**: Use OpenAI Structured Outputs (llguidance backend)
3. **Fallback C**: Use AICI if SMT mid-generation is truly required

### Future Enhancements

**Phase 6+: Advanced Features**
- Add Rust grammar for systems programming
- Add Go grammar for backend services
- Evaluate AICI for SMT-verified generation (if needed)
- Integrate parallel speculative decoding for TypedHole resolution
