## 1. Executive Summary

### Vision

**lift democratizes high-quality software creation** by providing AI-native development tools that work for everyone - from semi-technical contributors to professional developers to autonomous AI agents.

Traditional software development requires years of expertise. No-code/low-code tools are easy but produce brittle, low-quality results. AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot help experts but don't ensure correctness and lack transparency.

**lift bridges this gap** through:
- **Bidirectional translation**: Natural language ↔ Formal specification ↔ Verified code
- **Formal verification**: SMT solvers ensure specifications are satisfiable before code generation
- **Typed holes**: Make unknowns explicit, enable iterative refinement with AI assistance
- **Reverse mode**: Understand and refactor existing codebases through specification recovery
- **Full transparency**: Every decision has provenance, every change is traceable

### Value Proposition

**For Semi-Technical Users**: Create professional-quality features by describing intent. lift handles correctness, edge cases, and implementation details.

**For Professional Developers**: AI assistance with verification guarantees. Understand legacy code through automated specification recovery. Refactor safely via proven IR transformations.

**For Technical Leaders**: Full audit trails for compliance. Safe, explainable AI-generated code. Accelerate teams without sacrificing quality.

**For AI Agents**: Verifiable, explainable code generation with formal contracts. Programmatic API for autonomous development workflows.

### Gap Analysis

Current tools leave critical gaps that lift uniquely addresses:

#### Gap 1: Semi-Technical Users

**Problem**: Product managers, designers, technical writers, and other semi-technical contributors want to create features but lack coding expertise. No-code tools produce brittle results. AI tools require programming knowledge.

**lift Solution**: Natural language specs → Verified IR → Professional-quality code. Typed holes make unknowns explicit. AI guides refinement.

**Market Size**: Millions of semi-technical knowledge workers at software companies

#### Gap 2: Verifiability & Correctness

**Problem**: All current AI coding tools use probabilistic generation without verification. Users don't know if generated code is correct. Edge cases are missed. Security vulnerabilities introduced.

**lift Solution**: SMT solver verifies specifications are satisfiable before code generation. Refinement types express contracts. Counterexamples show conflicts.

**Market Need**: Enterprise customers require verified, auditable AI code generation

#### Gap 3: Legacy Code Understanding

**Problem**: Most code work is maintenance and refactoring, not greenfield development. Current AI tools focus on generation. Understanding large, undocumented codebases is manual and error-prone.

**lift Solution**: Reverse mode extracts formal specifications from existing code. Multi-file analysis with dependency graphs. AI-assisted intent recovery. Safe refactoring via IR transformations.

**Market Need**: Every company has legacy code that needs understanding and migration

#### Gap 4: Transparency & Provenance

**Problem**: AI-generated code is a "black box." Why was this generated? What assumptions were made? Can't explain to regulators or auditors. No audit trail for changes.

**lift Solution**: Intent ledger tracks all decisions. Alignment maps show IntentSpec ↔ FuncSpec relationships. Full provenance chains. Explainable to humans and regulators.

**Market Need**: Regulated industries (finance, healthcare, defense) require explainable AI

#### Gap 5: Human Agency

**Problem**: Current AI tools range from passive autocomplete (Copilot) to autonomous agents (Replit Agent). Users either do all the work or surrender all control. No middle ground.

**lift Solution**: Typed holes let users control refinement. AI suggests, users decide. Partial evaluation previews behavior. Users stay in the driver's seat.

**Market Need**: Professional developers want AI assistance, not AI replacement

#### Gap 6: Systematic AI Improvement

**Problem**: AI coding tools use manually-engineered prompts that don't improve over time. Quality plateaus. No learning from user feedback.

**lift Solution**: DSPy-based signatures enable automatic optimization. MIPROv2 learns from examples. Continuous learning pipeline. Quality improves monthly.

**Market Need**: Enterprises want AI that gets better with their proprietary codebase patterns

## 4. Product Vision & Strategy

### Vision Statement

**"Make software creation accessible to everyone while maintaining professional quality through AI-assisted formal verification and bidirectional translation."**

### Strategic Pillars

#### Pillar 1: Bidirectional Translation

**Forward Mode: Natural Language → Verified Code**

Users describe what they want in natural language or structured specs. lift:
1. Extracts intent (IntentSpec) with goals, roles, constraints
2. Generates signature with types and parameters
3. Creates formal specification (FuncSpec) with pre/post conditions
4. Uses SMT solver to verify spec is satisfiable
5. Identifies ambiguities as typed holes
6. Generates code with XGrammar constraints
7. Validates with best-of-N sampling and execution testing

**Reverse Mode: Code → Understanding + Refactoring**

Users point lift at existing code. lift:
1. Parses multi-file codebase with dependencies
2. Extracts types, signatures, call graphs
3. Infers constraints from assertions, types, patterns
4. Generates IntentSpec (human-readable goals)
5. Generates FuncSpec (formal contracts)
6. Creates alignment map showing correspondence
7. Enables safe refactoring via IR transformations

**Why Bidirectional Matters**: Most development is maintenance. Understanding matters as much as generation. Together, they close the loop: generate → deploy → understand → refactor → regenerate.

#### Pillar 2: Formal Verification

**The Problem with Probabilistic Generation**: LLMs hallucinate. They generate plausible-looking code that's subtly wrong. Edge cases missed. Security vulnerabilities introduced. No guarantees.

**lift's Solution: Constraint Solving**

Before generating code, lift proves specifications are satisfiable:
- **Refinement types**: `{x:Int | x >= 0}` expresses "non-negative integer"
- **Pre/post conditions**: `requires: balance >= amount, ensures: balance' = balance - amount`
- **SMT solver (Z3)**: Proves no contradictions exist
- **Counterexamples**: If unsatisfiable, provides concrete example showing conflict

**Three-Tier Solver Strategy**:
1. **CSP** (Constraint Satisfaction): Fast, for finite domains (enumerations, small ranges)
2. **SAT** (Boolean Satisfiability): Fast, for boolean logic and structural checks
3. **SMT** (Satisfiability Modulo Theories): Powerful, for arithmetic, arrays, theories

**Result**: Code is proven correct before generation. Users see counterexamples if specs conflict. No more "try it and see if it works."

#### Pillar 3: Typed Holes for Human Agency

**The Problem with Black-Box AI**: Current tools guess when specs are ambiguous. Guesses are often wrong. Users don't know what assumptions were made.

**lift's Solution: Explicit Unknowns**

Typed holes make unknowns explicit and refinement interactive:

**6 Hole Kinds**:
1. **Term holes** (`?value`): Unknown value or expression
2. **Type holes** (`?T`): Unknown type
3. **Spec holes** (`?contract`): Unknown specification or constraint
4. **Entity holes** (`?User`): Unknown entity or domain object
5. **Function holes** (`?helper`): Unknown helper function needed
6. **Module holes** (`?lib`): Unknown dependency or library

**Hole Features**:
- **Type annotations**: What kind of thing fills this hole?
- **Constraints**: What must be true of any solution?
- **Links**: Dependencies between holes
- **AI suggestions**: Ranked by confidence, context-aware
- **Provenance**: Why does this hole exist?

**User Workflow**:
1. lift generates IR with holes for ambiguities
2. User hovers over hole → sees type, constraints, suggestions
3. User can: accept suggestion, provide own value, split hole, leave for later
4. Constraints propagate: filling one hole narrows others
5. Partial evaluation: Run program with holes to see value flows

**Result**: Users control refinement. AI assists but doesn't guess. Process is transparent and iterative.

#### Pillar 4: Provenance & Transparency

**The Regulatory Challenge**: Regulated industries (finance, healthcare, defense) require explainable AI. "Why did the AI generate this code?" must have an answer.

**lift's Solution: Full Audit Trail**

**Intent Ledger** (append-only log):
- Every decision recorded: IntentAdded, SpecAligned, HoleFilled, CodeGenerated
- Who made the decision (user or AI)
- When it was made
- What changed (diffs)
- Why it was made (justification)

**Alignment Maps**:
- Show correspondence: IntentSpec atoms → FuncSpec predicates
- Confidence scores for each mapping
- Drift detection when implementation diverges from intent

**Provenance Chains**:
- Every IR element traces to origin (prompt, code, inference, solver, user)
- Derivation steps show how conclusions were reached
- Visualizations for human understanding

**Safety Manifests**:
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for dependencies
- SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) attestations
- OPA (Open Policy Agent) policy enforcement
- SLO declarations for non-functional requirements

**Result**: Full transparency. Regulators and auditors can trace every decision. Users understand why AI made choices. Compliance requirements met.

#### Pillar 5: Systematic AI Improvement

**The Stagnation Problem**: Current AI tools use manually-written prompts. Quality plateaus. No improvement without manual engineering.

**lift's Solution: DSPy-Based Optimization**

**DSPy Framework**:
- Replace brittle prompts with modular **signatures** (input/output contracts)
- Signatures are **optimizable** via algorithms (MIPROv2, BootstrapFewShot)
- Training examples: user corrections, successful generations, solver feedback
- Continuous learning: Quality improves monthly as lift learns patterns

**Pydantic AI Graphs**:
- Complex workflows as directed graphs of nodes
- Each node is a DSPy signature (optimizable)
- Parallel execution where possible
- Type-safe state management

**Optimization Loop**:
1. Collect examples (user corrections, successes, failures)
2. Run optimizer (MIPROv2) to improve signatures
3. A/B test new vs. old version
4. Deploy if statistically significant improvement
5. Repeat monthly

**Result**: lift gets better over time. Company-specific patterns learned. Quality improves continuously.

1. lift generates IR with holes for ambiguities
2. User sees holes highlighted in UI (yellow underline)
3. User hovers over hole `?error_handling`:
   - Type: `ErrorStrategy`
   - Constraints: "Must handle: InsufficientFunds, AccountNotFound, NetworkError"
   - Suggestions:
     - (90% confidence) "Return Result<T, TransferError>" ← recommended
     - (70% confidence) "Throw exceptions"
     - (50% confidence) "Use Either monad"
   - Why: "Function can fail in multiple ways, need explicit error handling strategy"
4. User accepts suggestion or provides custom value
5. Constraints propagate: Filling `?error_handling` → affects `?return_type`, `?test_cases`
6. User can split hole: `?error_handling` → `?network_errors` + `?business_errors`
7. User can leave holes: Partial evaluation shows value flows
8. User can undo/redo: Full revision history

**Hole Kinds & Use Cases**:

| Kind | Symbol | Example | Use Case |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| Term | `?value` | `?default_timeout` | Unknown constant or expression |
| Type | `?T` | `List<?T>` | Unknown type parameter |
| Spec | `?contract` | `requires: ?contract` | Unknown specification |
| Entity | `?User` | `class ?User` | Unknown domain entity |
| Function | `?helper` | `result = ?helper(data)` | Unknown helper function needed |
| Module | `?lib` | `import ?lib` | Unknown dependency |

  - NFR3.4: UI responsiveness: <50ms hover to tooltip
  - NFR3.5: Trace size: Limit to 1000 values per hole

**Success Metrics**:
- Suggestion acceptance rate: 60%+ (users accept AI suggestion without modification)
- Holes per request: Average 3-5 (too many = poor spec, too few = over-constraining)
- Time to fill all holes: <5 minutes for typical request
- User satisfaction: 8/10+ on "holes help me refine specs"

## 6. User Experiences

### Experience 1: Forward Mode - "Create a REST API"

**Scenario**: Sarah (Product Manager) wants to prototype a money transfer feature.

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **User Action**: Sarah opens lift web UI, creates new session, types:
   ```
   Create a REST API endpoint to transfer money between user accounts.
   The sender must have sufficient balance. Both accounts must exist.
   Transfers are atomic and logged for audit purposes.
   ```

2. **lift Response**: Generates IR with IntentSpec:
   ```
   Intent: "Enable secure money transfers between accounts"
   Roles:
     - Sender: User initiating transfer
     - Recipient: User receiving funds
     - System: Platform executing transfer
   Goals:
     - Transfer succeeds if sender has balance
     - Transfer is atomic (all-or-nothing)
     - All transfers logged for audit
   Constraints:
     - Sender and recipient accounts exist
     - Sender balance >= transfer amount
     - Amount > 0
   ```

3. **lift Response**: Generates signature with typed holes:
   ```python
   async def transfer(
       sender_id: UUID,
       recipient_id: UUID,
       amount: Money,
       ?idempotency_key: Optional[str] = None  # HOLE: prevent duplicate transfers?
   ) -> Result[Transfer, TransferError]:
       ...
   ```

4. **User Interaction**: Sarah hovers over `?idempotency_key` hole:
   - **Suggestion** (90% confidence): "Include idempotency_key for safe retries"
   - **Why**: "Network failures may cause retries. Idempotency prevents double-charging."
   - **Action**: Sarah clicks "Accept"

5. **lift Response**: Generates FuncSpec:
   ```
   Requires:
     - sender exists in accounts table
     - recipient exists in accounts table
     - sender != recipient
     - sender.balance >= amount
     - amount > 0
   Ensures:
     - sender.balance' = sender.balance - amount
     - recipient.balance' = recipient.balance + amount
     - Transfer record created in audit log
     - Idempotent: Same idempotency_key → same result
   ```

6. **Verification**: SMT solver checks satisfiability:
   - ✅ Satisfiable
   - No counterexamples

7. **Code Generation**: lift generates Python code:
   ```python
   from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, Depends
   from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
   from typing import Optional
   import uuid

   router = APIRouter()

   @router.post("/transfers")
   async def transfer(
       sender_id: uuid.UUID,
       recipient_id: uuid.UUID,
       amount: int,  # cents
       idempotency_key: Optional[str] = None,
       db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
   ) -> dict:
       # Input validation
       if amount <= 0:
           raise HTTPException(400, "Amount must be positive")
       if sender_id == recipient_id:
           raise HTTPException(400, "Cannot transfer to self")

       # Check idempotency
       if idempotency_key:
           existing = await db.execute(
               select(Transfer).where(Transfer.idempotency_key == idempotency_key)
           )
           if existing.scalar_one_or_none():
               return existing.scalar_one().to_dict()  # Return cached result

       # Begin transaction
       async with db.begin():
           # Lock accounts for update
           sender = await db.execute(
               select(Account).where(Account.id == sender_id).with_for_update()
           )
           sender = sender.scalar_one_or_none()
           if not sender:
               raise HTTPException(404, "Sender account not found")

           recipient = await db.execute(
               select(Account).where(Account.id == recipient_id).with_for_update()
           )
           recipient = recipient.scalar_one_or_none()
           if not recipient:
               raise HTTPException(404, "Recipient account not found")

           # Check balance
           if sender.balance < amount:
               raise HTTPException(400, "Insufficient funds")

           # Execute transfer
           sender.balance -= amount
           recipient.balance += amount

           # Create audit log
           transfer = Transfer(
               id=uuid.uuid4(),
               sender_id=sender_id,
               recipient_id=recipient_id,
               amount=amount,
               idempotency_key=idempotency_key,
               timestamp=datetime.utcnow()
           )
           db.add(transfer)
           await db.flush()

       return transfer.to_dict()
   ```

8. **Validation**: lift runs tests:
   - ✅ Compiles without errors
   - ✅ Type checks pass
   - ✅ Execution tests: 5/5 scenarios pass

9. **Delivery**: Sarah sees split view:
   - Left: Original prompt + IR
   - Right: Generated code with syntax highlighting
   - Bottom: Test results

10. **User Action**: Sarah clicks "Copy to Clipboard", pastes into GitHub PR, adds description using IntentSpec.

**Outcome**: Sarah created a production-ready API endpoint in 3 minutes without writing code. All edge cases handled. Audit trail complete.

### Experience 2: Reverse Mode - "Understand Legacy Service"

**Scenario**: Marcus (Senior Engineer) needs to understand a legacy Python service (10K LOC, no documentation, original author left).

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **User Action**: Marcus runs CLI:
   ```bash
   lift reverse /path/to/legacy-service --output specs.md
   ```

2. **lift Response**: Analyzes codebase:
   ```
   Discovering files... 47 Python files (10,234 LOC)
   Parsing... 100%
   Building dependency graph... 23 modules, 156 functions
   Extracting types... 89% coverage
   Inferring constraints... 234 predicates found
   Generating IntentSpec...
   Generating FuncSpec...
   Creating alignment map...
   Done in 42s
   ```

3. **lift Output**: Writes `specs.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Legacy Service Specification

   ## Intent

   **Summary**: Order fulfillment service that processes e-commerce orders, manages inventory, and coordinates shipping.

   **Roles**:
   - Customer: Places orders
   - Merchant: Supplies inventory
   - Warehouse: Fulfills orders
   - Shipping Provider: Delivers packages

   **Goals**:
   - Process orders within 5 minutes
   - Prevent overselling (inventory tracking)
   - Coordinate multi-warehouse fulfillment
   - Handle partial fulfillments
   - Retry failed shipments

   **Constraints**:
   - Orders are immutable once placed
   - Inventory decrements are atomic
   - Failed shipments retry up to 3 times
   - Partial fulfillments create backorders

   ## Core Functions

   ### `process_order(order_id: UUID) -> OrderResult`

   **Spec**:
   - Requires: Order exists, not already processed
   - Ensures: Inventory decremented OR backorder created
   - Effects: Database writes, external API calls (shipping)
   - Confidence: 92% (high)

   **Alignment**:
   - Goal "Process orders within 5 minutes" → timeout=300s
   - Goal "Prevent overselling" → atomic inventory check+decrement
   - Constraint "Retry failed shipments" → retry logic with exponential backoff

   ### `allocate_inventory(order_id: UUID, items: List[Item]) -> AllocationResult`

   **Spec**:
   - Requires: Items available across >=1 warehouse
   - Ensures: Inventory reserved atomically
   - Effects: Row-level locks on inventory table
   - Confidence: 87%

   **Alignment**:
   - Goal "Coordinate multi-warehouse fulfillment" → warehouse selection logic
   - Constraint "Partial fulfillments create backorders" → split allocation

   ## Inferred Business Rules

   1. **Atomicity**: Inventory operations use transactions with row locks
   2. **Idempotency**: Order processing checks `processed_at` timestamp
   3. **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s), max 3 attempts
   4. **Timeout Policy**: 5-minute hard limit on order processing
   5. **Partial Fulfillment**: Items split across warehouses, remainder backordered

   ## Dependencies

   - PostgreSQL 12+ (inventory table requires row-level locking)
   - Redis (idempotency cache, 24h TTL)
   - ShipStation API (shipping provider)
   - Sentry (error tracking)

   ## Security Concerns

   ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: No authentication on `/admin/reprocess-order` endpoint
   ⚠️ **HIGH**: SQL injection risk in `build_inventory_query()` (line 423)
   ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: Hardcoded API key in `shipstation_client.py` (line 12)
   ```

4. **User Action**: Marcus opens lift web UI, loads session, explores split-view:
   - Left: `process_order` function code
   - Right: IntentSpec + FuncSpec for that function
   - Synchronized scrolling

5. **User Interaction**: Marcus hovers over `allocate_inventory` call:
   - See IntentSpec: "Reserve inventory atomically across warehouses"
   - See FuncSpec: Pre/post conditions
   - See call graph: 4 callers, 7 callees
   - Click "View Implementation" → jumps to code

6. **User Action**: Marcus identifies refactoring opportunity. Uses lift:
   ```
   Refactor: Extract retry logic into reusable decorator
   ```

7. **lift Response**: Generates IR transformation:
   - Proves: New implementation equivalent to old
   - Shows: Code before/after
   - Test plan: Existing tests should still pass

8. **User Action**: Marcus accepts refactoring, applies to codebase, runs tests:
   ```bash
   lift apply-refactoring session-xyz
   pytest tests/  # All pass ✅
   ```

**Outcome**: Marcus understood a 10K-line legacy service in 1 hour (vs. 1 week manually). Found 3 security issues. Safely refactored with zero regressions.

### Experience 3: Interactive Refinement - "Resolve Ambiguities"

**Scenario**: Sarah (PM) is refining a feature spec with multiple ambiguities.

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **User Action**: Sarah types prompt:
   ```
   Create a notification system that alerts users about important events.
   Users can configure preferences. High-priority alerts bypass quiet hours.
   ```

2. **lift Response**: Generates IR with 7 holes:
   - `?notification_channel` (term): Email, SMS, Push, Slack?
   - `?priority_levels` (type): How many levels? What are they?
   - `?quiet_hours_definition` (spec): User-defined or global?
   - `?preference_granularity` (spec): Per-event-type? Per-channel?
   - `?delivery_guarantee` (spec): At-least-once? Exactly-once?
   - `?retry_strategy` (function): How to handle failures?
   - `?event_types` (entity): What events trigger notifications?

3. **UI View**: Sarah sees IR with holes highlighted:
   ```
   Intent: "Alert users about important events"

   Signature:
     notify(
       user_id: UUID,
       event: ?event_types,        ← HOLE 1
       priority: ?priority_levels  ← HOLE 2
     ) -> Result[Notification, NotificationError]

   Spec:
     requires:
       - User has notification preferences configured
       - ?delivery_guarantee        ← HOLE 3

     ensures:
       - If priority = HIGH, send immediately
       - If priority != HIGH and within quiet hours, defer
       - Notification sent via ?notification_channel ← HOLE 4
   ```

4. **Interaction**: Sarah clicks on `?notification_channel`:
   - **Suggestions**:
     - (85% confidence) "Multi-channel: Email + Push (high), Email (normal), None (low)"
     - (70% confidence) "Email only"
     - (60% confidence) "User choice per notification"
   - **Why**: "Different priorities often use different urgency channels"
   - **Examples**: "Slack uses email for important, push for urgent, none for FYI"

5. **User Action**: Sarah clicks "Customize", enters:
   ```
   High priority: SMS + Email
   Normal priority: Email
   Low priority: In-app only
   ```

6. **Constraint Propagation**: Filling `?notification_channel` affects:
   - `?delivery_guarantee` narrows to "Best-effort for SMS, at-least-once for Email/In-app"
   - `?retry_strategy` updates to "SMS: 3 retries, Email: 5 retries, In-app: unlimited (lazy)"

7. **User Action**: Sarah fills `?event_types` by selecting from catalog:
   - [x] OrderPlaced (normal)
   - [x] PaymentFailed (high)
   - [x] ShipmentDelivered (low)
   - [x] SecurityAlert (high)
   - [ ] InventoryLow (skip for now - hole remains)

8. **Partial Evaluation**: Sarah clicks "Preview" → lift runs with holes:
   ```
   Scenario: PaymentFailed event for user Alice

   Evaluation:
     ✅ priority = HIGH (from event mapping)
     ✅ quiet_hours = FALSE (high priority bypasses)
     ✅ channels = [SMS, Email]
     ⏸️  retry_strategy = ?retry_strategy  ← Still a hole

   Trace for ?retry_strategy:
     - Input: channel=SMS, attempt=1
     - Expected output: Should retry? Wait how long?
     - Observed flows: 3 attempts, exponential backoff
   ```

9. **AI Suggestion Updated**: Based on partial eval trace:
   - (95% confidence) "Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, max 3 attempts" ← confidence increased!
   - **Why**: "Trace shows 3 retry attempts, this matches common SMS provider patterns"

10. **User Action**: Sarah accepts updated suggestion. All holes filled except `InventoryLow` event.

11. **Code Generation**: lift generates code with placeholder for `InventoryLow`:
    ```python
    async def notify(user_id: UUID, event: Event, priority: Priority):
        # ... implementation ...

        # TODO: Handle InventoryLow event (hole: ?inventory_event_handling)
        # Suggestion: Batch notifications daily, send to warehouse managers only
        pass
    ```

**Outcome**: Sarah refined complex feature spec in 10 minutes through interactive dialogue. Partial evaluation helped AI improve suggestions. One hole deferred for future work.

### Experience 4: Agentic Use - "Autonomous Code Generation"

**Scenario**: AgentAI (autonomous system) needs to generate verified database migration for schema change.

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Agent Action**: AgentAI calls lift API:
   ```python
   import lift_sdk

   client = lift_sdk.Client(api_key=os.getenv("LIFT_API_KEY"))

   spec = """
   Add a 'last_login' column to the users table.
   Type: Timestamp with timezone
   Default: NULL for existing rows
   Add index for query performance
   Migration must be reversible
   """

   session = client.sessions.create()
   result = client.forward_mode.generate(
       session_id=session.id,
       prompt=spec,
       verification_level="strict",  # Require solver verification
       holes_strategy="auto_fill"     # Auto-fill with high-confidence suggestions
   )
   ```

2. **lift Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "session_id": "sess_xyz",

3. **Agent Validation**: AgentAI checks:
   - ✅ `verification.satisfiable == true`
   - ✅ All holes auto-filled (no human input needed)
   - ✅ Code includes reversible migration
   - ⚠️  Warning about table lock → Agent checks table size

4. **Agent Action**: Table is small (10K rows), proceed with migration:
   ```python
   # Apply migration
   migration_result = client.sessions.apply_code(
       session_id=session.id,
       environment="staging",  # Test first
       dry_run=False
   )

   # Record in intent ledger
   client.provenance.record_event(
       session_id=session.id,
       event_type="MigrationApplied",
       justification="Automated deployment by AgentAI after verification",
       metadata={"environment": "staging", "applied_at": "2025-10-21T14:33:05Z"}
   )
   ```

5. **Monitoring**: AgentAI polls migration status:
   ```python
   status = client.sessions.get_status(session.id)
   assert status["migration"]["status"] == "success"
   assert status["migration"]["rows_affected"] == 10234
   ```

6. **Audit Trail**: AgentAI generates report for humans:
   ```python
   audit_report = client.provenance.export_report(
       session_id=session.id,
       format="pdf"
   )
   # Upload to compliance system
   upload_to_s3(audit_report, "migrations/2025-10-21_add_last_login.pdf")
   ```

7. **Notification**: AgentAI notifies team:
   ```python
   slack.post_message(
       channel="#deployments",
       text=f"Migration applied to staging: Add last_login column to users table.\n"
            f"Session: {session.id}\n"
            f"Verified: ✅ SMT solver confirmed satisfiability\n"
            f"Audit report: s3://bucket/migrations/{session.id}.pdf\n"
            f"Rollback: Available via `lift rollback {session.id}`"
   )
   ```

**Outcome**: AgentAI autonomously generated, verified, and deployed database migration in 45 seconds. Full audit trail for compliance. Humans notified and can review/rollback.

## 10. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Critical Risks

#### R1: LLM Quality Variability

**Risk**: LLMs hallucinate, generate incorrect code, quality is unpredictable

**Likelihood**: High (inherent to LLMs)
**Impact**: High (core value proposition)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Formal verification**: SMT solver catches contradictions before code generation
2. **XGrammar constraints**: Ensure syntactic correctness
3. **Best-of-N sampling**: Generate multiple candidates, rank by quality
4. **DSPy optimization**: Systematic improvement over time
5. **Human-in-the-loop**: Typed holes keep users in control
6. **Multi-provider**: Fallback to different models on failure
7. **Continuous monitoring**: Track quality metrics, alert on degradation

**Contingency**: If LLM quality degrades unacceptably, increase human oversight, reduce automation level

---

#### R2: Solver Performance

**Risk**: SMT queries too slow for interactive use, timeout frequently

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (blocks core workflow)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Tiered approach**: CSP → SAT → SMT (fast → medium → slow)
2. **Query optimization**: Simplify predicates, cache results
3. **Incremental solving**: Z3 push/pop for interactive refinement
4. **Timeout handling**: 5s budget with fallback to heuristics
5. **Profiling**: Identify slow queries, optimize encodings
6. **Lazy solving**: Only verify on demand, not eagerly

**Contingency**: If solvers too slow, make verification optional (user toggle), optimize hot paths

---

#### R3: Adoption Barriers

**Risk**: Users find tool too complex, prefer simpler alternatives (Copilot)

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (market failure)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Progressive disclosure**: Simple mode (no holes, no verification) for beginners
2. **Excellent UX**: Invest heavily in onboarding, tutorials
3. **Quick wins**: Ensure first session produces working code in <10 minutes
4. **Templates**: Pre-built patterns for common use cases
5. **Free tier**: Low-friction trial
6. **Success metrics**: Track activation, identify drop-off points

**Contingency**: If adoption slow, pivot to narrower use case (e.g., enterprise compliance only), simplify UX

---

#### R4: Competition

**Risk**: Incumbents (GitHub, Microsoft, Google) copy features or undercut on price

**Likelihood**: High (if we succeed)
**Impact**: Medium (can differentiate)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Defensibility**: Formal verification is hard, requires deep expertise
2. **First-mover advantage**: Build user base before incumbents react
3. **Product velocity**: Ship features faster, stay ahead
4. **Enterprise focus**: Compliance features create lock-in
5. **Community**: Open-source core, build ecosystem
6. **Pricing**: Competitive but sustainable

**Contingency**: If price war, focus on enterprise (higher willingness to pay), emphasize unique features

---

#### R5: Cost Management

**Risk**: LLM and GPU costs too high, unit economics unsustainable

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (business viability)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Efficient inference**: vLLM with XGrammar for fast, constrained generation
2. **Caching**: Aggressive caching of LLM responses, solver results
3. **Tiering**: Free tier limits, paid tiers have higher caps
4. **Optimization**: DSPy reduces unnecessary LLM calls
5. **Multi-provider**: Optimize for cost/performance tradeoff
6. **Monitoring**: Track unit economics, alert on overspend

**Contingency**: If costs too high, reduce free tier, increase prices, optimize inference stack

---

### Medium Risks

#### R6: Regulatory Compliance

**Risk**: Regulations (EU AI Act, etc.) impose restrictions on AI code generation

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (addressable with features)

**Mitigation**:
- Provenance features (intent ledger) provide audit trail
- Safety manifests (SBOM, SLSA) for compliance
- Explainability built-in (alignment maps, counterexamples)
- Legal review of regulations, product adjustments

---

#### R7: Security Vulnerabilities

**Risk**: lift generates code with security flaws or is itself compromised

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (reputation damage)

**Mitigation**:
- Security analysis integration (CodeQL)
- Formal verification catches some vulnerabilities
- Security-focused testing (OWASP Top 10)
- Bug bounty program
- Regular security audits
- SOC 2 compliance

---

#### R8: Talent Acquisition

**Risk**: Can't hire enough expertise in PL, formal methods, AI

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (slows roadmap)

**Mitigation**:
- Academic partnerships for recruiting
- Competitive compensation
- Remote-first (global talent pool)
- Strong engineering culture
- Open-source contributions (attract talent)

---

### Low Risks

#### R9: Infrastructure Outages

**Risk**: Modal, Supabase, or Vercel down → lift unavailable

**Likelihood**: Low (vendors have high uptime)
**Impact**: Medium (temporary disruption)

**Mitigation**:
- Multi-provider fallback (LLMs)
- Caching and offline mode (future)
- Status page and monitoring
- Customer communication during outages

---

#### R10: Data Loss

**Risk**: Session data lost due to bug or infrastructure failure

**Likelihood**: Low (Supabase has backups)
**Impact**: High (user trust)

**Mitigation**:
- Daily database backups (30-day retention)
- Export feature (users can backup locally)
- Immutable audit log (event sourcing)
- Testing: Data integrity tests

---
