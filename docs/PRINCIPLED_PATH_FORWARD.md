# Principled Path Forward: Lift-Sys Strategic Analysis

**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Context**: Phase 3 testing complete at 77.8% (14/18), 2.2% below 80% goal
**Purpose**: Synthesize research, assess current state, propose principled next steps

---

## Executive Summary

**The Tension**: We're caught between pragmatic "quick wins" (switch to Claude 3.5, adjust temperature) and principled long-term approaches (constraint propagation, semantic IR enhancement).

**The Insight**: At 77.8% success with a 6-month-old open-weights model and minimal prompt engineering, **our core approach is fundamentally sound**. The question isn't whether to rebuild the foundation—it's how to systematically improve what's already working.

**The Recommendation**: Follow a staged approach that validates assumptions at each step before investing in complex solutions.

## Current State Analysis

### What the Numbers Tell Us

**Strong baseline** (77.8% with Qwen2.5-32B):
- **100% success** on 4 categories: control_flow, mathematical, edge_cases, type_operations (10/18 tests)
- **66.7% success** on list_operations (2/3 tests)
- **50% success** on data_structures (1/2 tests)
- **33.3% success** on string_manipulation (1/3 tests)

**Key observation**: The model excels at structured logic (control flow, math, types) but struggles with string operations and complex data structures. This isn't a fundamental flaw—it's a **specific weakness in a specific domain**.

### What Research Tells Us

From `docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_STATE_OF_ART.md`, state-of-the-art techniques:

1. **Semantic IR Design** (IRCoder, 2024): Compiler-like IRs improve robustness
2. **Verification-Guided Synthesis** (2024-2025): LLM + SMT solver achieves 100% on benchmarks
3. **Example-Driven Synthesis** (PERC, CODEEXEMPLAR): Strategic few-shot improves by 25.4%
4. **Execution-Guided Refinement** (AlphaCode, CEGIS): Generate → test → refine loops
5. **AST-Based Repair**: Direct manipulation fixes control flow bugs

**Critical insight**: These techniques work, but they're **expensive** (6-16 weeks implementation, ongoing research complexity). They make sense once we've exhausted simpler approaches.

### What Experiments Told Us

**Best-of-N failure** taught us:
- Quality scoring is hard (verbosity ≠ correctness)
- Diversity requires sufficient temperature (0.5 too low)
- Model-specific tuning matters (Qwen2.5-32B is deterministic)
- **But**: The baseline is strong enough that sampling didn't help

This is actually **good news**—it means our IR prompting is already near-optimal for this model.

## The Over-Planning Trap

### Research Completed But Not Implemented

From Beads and docs:

1. **Constraint Propagation** (lift-sys-181):
   - 8 phases planned (Phase 0-7)
   - 120-160 hours estimated
   - Fully researched and designed
   - Status: Not started

2. **Semantic IR Enhancement**:
   - 6 phases, 224 Beads created
   - 70-161 tasks per phase
   - Comprehensive design complete
   - Status: Deferred until core loop works

3. **Production Deployment** (lift-sys-53):
   - Week 9-10 timeline
   - Security audit, infrastructure, beta program
   - Status: Planned but blocked

### The Pattern

**Over-planning syndrome**: We've designed elaborate solutions to problems we haven't fully diagnosed.

**From `REALITY_CHECK_AND_PLAN.md` (Oct 14, 2025)**:
> "Stop adding features. Make ONE workflow actually work. Then expand."

**The wisdom**: Complex solutions are appealing, but they're premature when simple experiments haven't been exhausted.

## Principled Decision Framework

### Stage 1: Validate Assumptions (1-2 days)

**Hypothesis**: Better models or simple parameter tuning can reach 80%+

**Experiments to run**:

1. **Claude 3.5 baseline** (1 hour)
   - Why: Proven reasoning, instruction following
   - Cost: ~$0.015/IR (comparable to Best-of-N)
   - Expected: 85-95% based on similar benchmarks
   - **If succeeds**: We have our 80%+ solution
   - **If fails**: Proves model quality alone isn't the issue

2. **Best-of-N with temperature=0.8** (15 min)
   - Why: Validate if diversity was the limiting factor
   - Cost: ~$0.17 (already budgeted)
   - Expected: More diverse candidates
   - **If succeeds**: Optimize temperature and sampling
   - **If fails**: Confirms scoring rubric is fundamentally flawed

3. **Hybrid routing** (2-3 hours)
   - Why: Leverage known strengths (Qwen=structured logic, Claude=string ops)
   - Cost: ~$0.009/IR blended
   - Expected: 90-92% with optimal cost
   - **If succeeds**: Best cost/quality balance
   - **If fails**: Tells us categories aren't the right split

**Principle**: Run cheap experiments that provide maximum information about failure modes.

### Stage 2: Systematic Improvement (1-2 weeks)

**Only proceed here if Stage 1 experiments all fail**

Based on failure analysis, choose ONE approach:

**Option A: Prompt Engineering Refinement**
- Analyze failed test cases in detail
- Extract common failure patterns
- Enhance IR prompt with:
  - Domain-specific examples (string manipulation)
  - Explicit instructions for edge cases
  - Clearer specification of control flow
- **Investment**: 3-5 days
- **Expected gain**: 3-5% (80-83%)

**Option B: Multi-Shot with Better Selection**
- Increase to 5-10 candidates for weak categories
- Implement test-based scoring (actually run code)
- Use test results to select best candidate
- **Investment**: 5-7 days
- **Expected gain**: 5-8% (83-86%)

**Option C: AST Repair Phase**
- Already implemented (`lift_sys/codegen/ast_repair.py`)
- Focus on string manipulation bugs:
  - Missing return statements
  - Off-by-one errors in loops
  - Incomplete validation logic
- **Investment**: 2-3 days
- **Expected gain**: 3-4% (81-82%)

**Principle**: Choose the approach that targets diagnosed failure modes, not theoretical improvements.

### Stage 3: Research-Backed Enhancement (4-8 weeks)

**Only proceed here if we've hit 80%+ and want to push toward 95%+**

Now the research investments make sense:

**Path A: Constraint Propagation (4-6 weeks)**
- **Rationale**: Systematic handling of inter-dependencies
- **Research**: Complete (docs/CONSTRAINT_PROPAGATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- **Implementation**: Phased (8 phases, 120-160 hours)
- **Expected gain**: 5-10% through better hole filling
- **When to choose**: If failures show dependency-related issues

**Path B: Verification-Guided Synthesis (6-8 weeks)**
- **Rationale**: Formal guarantees of correctness
- **Research**: State-of-art shows 100% on benchmarks
- **Implementation**: Integrate Z3, implement CEGIS loop
- **Expected gain**: 10-15% through verified generation
- **When to choose**: If failures are logic errors (not syntax/structure)

**Path C: Semantic IR Enhancement (10-16 weeks)**
- **Rationale**: Compiler-like representations, language-agnostic semantics
- **Research**: Extensive (224 Beads, full design)
- **Implementation**: 6 phases, incremental deployment
- **Expected gain**: 15-20% through better semantic understanding
- **When to choose**: **REQUIRED for production** (multi-language support)
- **Approach**: Start Phase 1 (Enhanced IR Data Models) after Python ≥80%

**Principle**: Invest in Semantic IR for production requirements, but validate Python-first approach before expanding scope.

## Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1: Validation Sprint

**Monday-Tuesday**: Quick experiments
- [ ] Run Claude 3.5 baseline on Phase 3 tests
- [ ] Run Best-of-N with temperature=0.8
- [ ] Analyze results and failure modes

**Wednesday-Thursday**: Implement winner or hybrid
- [ ] If Claude 3.5 ≥80%: Integrate and stabilize

### Week 4+: Research Enhancement (If Goal Exceeded)

**Only if we've exceeded 80% and want to push higher**

- [ ] Review failure modes from successful approach
- [ ] Choose research path (CSP, Verification, Semantic IR)
- [ ] Create detailed implementation timeline
- [ ] Begin Phase 0

## Addressing the Research

### What to Do With Existing Plans

**Constraint Propagation (lift-sys-181)**:
- **Status**: Excellent research, premature implementation
- **Action**: Archive design, revisit in Stage 3
- **Trigger**: If we diagnose dependency-related failures after hitting 80%

**Semantic IR (224 Beads)**:
- **Status**: Essential for production (multi-language requirement)
- **Action**: Phase incrementally - start after Python baseline solid
- **Trigger**: After reaching 80%+ on Python, begin language-agnostic IR design
- **Timeline**: Weeks 4-20, parallel with Python optimization

**Production Deployment (lift-sys-53)**:
- **Status**: Blocked on quality
- **Action**: Keep timeline, unblock after ≥80% sustained
- **Trigger**: After 2 weeks of stable ≥80% performance

### Principle: Just-In-Time Planning

**Don't delete research**, but don't let it drive decisions either.

- Keep design documents as reference
- Close Beads for unstarted work (can always reopen)
- Focus planning energy on validated next steps
- Let empirical results guide research priorities

## Key Learnings Applied

### From REALITY_CHECK_AND_PLAN.md
> "Make ONE workflow actually work. Then expand."

**Application**: Stage 1 focuses on getting to 80% with existing infrastructure before building new systems.

### From Best-of-N Analysis
> "Baseline already strong (77.8%). Complex solutions may not help if simple ones work."

**Application**: Try model upgrades and parameter tuning before investing in CSP solvers or semantic enhancements.

### From State-of-Art Research
> "Verification-guided synthesis achieves 100%, but requires significant investment."

**Application**: Reserve research-backed approaches for Stage 3, after validating they're needed.

### From Current Results
> "100% on structured logic, 33% on string manipulation. Problem is specific, not general."

**Application**: Target improvements at diagnosed weaknesses (string ops) rather than rebuilding everything.

## Conclusion

**The Principled Path**: Validate assumptions with cheap experiments, then systematically improve based on evidence, reserving research-backed solutions for when they're actually needed.

**Current Status**: We're 2.2% away from our goal with solid infrastructure and a strong baseline. We don't need to redesign the system—we need to make targeted improvements.

**Recommended Next Step**: Run Stage 1 experiments (Claude 3.5, temperature=0.8, hybrid) before investing in complex solutions. Let empirical results guide our research priorities.

**The Wisdom**: Build what we need when we need it, not what might be useful someday.
