# Implementation Summary - IR Generation Improvements

**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR TESTING**

---

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Plans Created

#### A. Semantic IR Improvement Plan (`docs/SEMANTIC_IR_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`)
**Addresses Phase 3 results (72.2% success)**

**Key Components**:
- ✅ Detailed failure analysis for all 5 failing tests
- ✅ Gap analysis of current IR prompt
- ✅ Four improvement strategies with implementation details
- ✅ Model comparison (Qwen 7B/32B, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5)
- ✅ Test-time compute techniques (Best-of-N, CoT, hybrid)
- ✅ Fine-tuning approach and timeline
- ✅ Phased implementation plan with effort estimates

**Recommended Path**: Few-shot prompts + Qwen3-30B + Best-of-N

---

#### B. Fine-Tuning + Synthetic Data Plan (`docs/FINE_TUNING_SYNTHETIC_DATA_PLAN.md`)
**For future production optimization (when >1000 IRs expected)**

**Key Components**:
- ✅ Synthetic data generation (template-based + LLM expansion)
- ✅ Claude 3.5 reference IR generation
- ✅ Manual review process (28-57 hours)
- ✅ Negative example generation
- ✅ LoRA fine-tuning configuration
- ✅ Training script and deployment
- ✅ Cost estimate: $13.70 total, 76% ongoing cost reduction

**Timeline**: 6 weeks (defer until after test-time compute evaluation)

---

#### C. CoT + Best-of-N Hybrid Plan (`docs/COT_BEST_OF_N_HYBRID_PLAN.md`)
**Maximum quality test-time compute (if Best-of-N alone <90%)**

**Key Components**:
- ✅ Chain-of-Thought prompt design (4-step reasoning)
- ✅ Hybrid translator implementation
- ✅ CoT-aware quality scoring
- ✅ A/B comparison testing framework
- ✅ Cost/performance analysis (4.5x cost for +20-30% quality)
- ✅ Decision criteria and monitoring

**Expected**: 88-94% Phase 3 success (target ≥90%)

---

### 2. Code Implementations

#### A. Modal App Updated to Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct
**File**: `lift_sys/inference/modal_app.py`

**Changes**:
```python
# Old: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct on A10G ($1.10/hr)
MODEL_NAME = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct"
GPU_CONFIG = "A10G"

# New: Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct on A100-80GB ($4/hr)
MODEL_NAME = "Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct"
GPU_CONFIG = "A100-80GB"
```

**Why Qwen3-30B**:
- ✅ MoE architecture: 30B params, ~3B active (efficient)
- ✅ Latest generation (better than Qwen2.5)
- ✅ Better reasoning and instruction-following
- ✅ Expected: 82-88% Phase 3 success (vs 72% baseline)

**Cost Impact**: +$3/hr GPU cost (~6x per request, but still cheap: $0.015/IR)

---

#### B. Best-of-N Sampling Implemented
**File**: `lift_sys/forward_mode/best_of_n_translator.py`

**Features**:
- Generates N=3 candidates in parallel
- Quality scoring based on 7 criteria:
  1. Assertion count (+10 each, max 50)
  2. Effect detail (+20 for specificity)
  3. Literal string markers (+15 each) ← Critical for our failing tests
  4. Python quirk handling (+10 each)
  5. Type hint completeness (+10 each)
  6. Edge case coverage (+5 each)
  7. Intent clarity (+5 each)
- Selects best candidate automatically

**Expected Impact**: +10-15% success (72% → 82-86% with Qwen3-30B)

**Cost**: 3x inference cost (~$0.045/IR total with Qwen3-30B)

---

---

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Modal App

```bash
# Deploy Qwen3-30B model to Modal
cd /Users/rand/src/lift-sys
modal deploy lift_sys/inference/modal_app.py
```

**Expected**:
- Cold start: ~60-90 seconds (larger model)
- Warm inference: ~3-5 seconds
- Cost: $4/hr GPU (A100-80GB)

---

### Step 2: Update Benchmark to Use Best-of-N

**File**: `performance_benchmark.py` or create `run_phase3_with_best_of_n.py`

```python
from lift_sys.providers.modal_provider import ModalProvider
from lift_sys.forward_mode.best_of_n_translator import BestOfNIRTranslator

async def run_phase3_with_best_of_n():
    """Run Phase 3 tests with Best-of-N sampling."""

    provider = ModalProvider(endpoint_url="https://rand--generate.modal.run")
    await provider.initialize({})

    # Use Best-of-N translator
    translator = BestOfNIRTranslator(
        provider=provider,
        n_candidates=3,  # Generate 3 IRs, pick best
        temperature=0.5   # Higher for diversity
    )

    # Run tests with Best-of-N
    results = []
    for test in PHASE_3_TESTS:
        print(f"\nTesting: {test['name']}")

        # Generate IR with Best-of-N
        ir = await translator.translate(test['prompt'])

        # ... rest of test execution ...

    return results
```

---

### Step 3: Compare Results

**Run three test configurations**:

```bash
# Baseline (Qwen 2.5-7B, no Best-of-N)
# Already have: phase3_with_phase5a.log → 72.2% success

# Configuration 1: Qwen3-30B alone (no Best-of-N)
uv run python run_nontrivial_tests.py phase3 > phase3_qwen3_30b_baseline.log

# Configuration 2: Qwen3-30B + Best-of-N (N=3)
uv run python run_phase3_with_best_of_n.py > phase3_qwen3_30b_best_of_n.log
```

**Expected Results**:
| Configuration | Expected Success | Cost/Test | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|-------|
| Qwen2.5-7B baseline | 72.2% (actual) | $0.005 | Current |
| Qwen3-30B alone | 82-88% | $0.015 | Model upgrade |
| Qwen3-30B + Best-of-N | 88-94% | $0.045 | Full implementation |

---

### Step 4: Decision Point

**If Qwen3-30B + Best-of-N achieves ≥90%**:
- ✅ **Success!** - Move to full validation
- Document results
- Proceed with production deployment planning

**If Qwen3-30B + Best-of-N achieves 85-89%**:
- ⚠️ **Good but not great** - Consider CoT hybrid
- Implement CoT + Best-of-N (7-12 hours)
- Re-test, target 90%+

**If Qwen3-30B + Best-of-N achieves <85%**:
- ❌ **Disappointing** - Investigate deeper issues
- Check if IR is the problem or code generation
- Consider Claude 3.5 for IR generation
- May need architectural changes

## Cost Summary

### One-Time Costs
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Modal deployment testing | $2-5 (cold starts, testing) |
| Phase 3 testing (Qwen3-30B) | ~$0.30 (18 tests × $0.015) |
| Phase 3 testing (Best-of-N) | ~$0.90 (18 tests × 3 × $0.015) |
| **Total Week 1** | **~$3.50** |

### Ongoing Costs (Per IR)
| Configuration | Cost/IR | When to Use |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Qwen2.5-7B baseline | $0.005 | Development only |
| Qwen3-30B | $0.015 | If >85% success |
| Qwen3-30B + Best-of-N | $0.045 | If need 90%+ |
| Qwen3-30B + CoT hybrid | $0.067 | If need 95%+ |
| Fine-tuned (future) | $0.003 | Production >1k/mo |

**Recommendation**: Start with Best-of-N, expect ~$0.045/IR (still very cheap)

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Acceptable
- ✅ Phase 3 success ≥85% (up from 72.2%)
- ✅ Literal string failures reduced to 0-1 (from 2)
- ✅ Type checking failures reduced to 0 (from 1)

### Target
- ✅ Phase 3 success ≥90%
- ✅ All systematic failures eliminated
- ✅ Cost per IR <$0.05

### Stretch Goal
- ✅ Phase 3 success ≥95%
- ✅ Ready for production deployment
- ✅ Fine-tuning plan ready to execute

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
✅ Modal deployment (tested before, should work)
✅ Best-of-N implementation (straightforward, well-tested pattern)
✅ Cost (even with 3x multiplier, still <$0.05/IR)

### Medium Risk
⚠️ Qwen3-30B availability (may need to check HuggingFace model hub)
⚠️ A100-80GB availability on Modal (may have queue times)
⚠️ Improvement magnitude (82-88% is estimate, could be lower)

### Mitigation
- Check Qwen3 model availability before deploying
- Have fallback to Qwen2.5-32B if Qwen3 not available
- Test on Phase 2 first (faster, cheaper) before full Phase 3

---

## Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ Ready to deploy and test

**What's Next**:
1. Deploy updated Modal app (30 min)
2. Run Phase 3 tests (2-3 hours total)
3. Analyze results and decide on CoT hybrid (1 hour)

**Expected Outcome**: 82-94% Phase 3 success (target: ≥90%)

**All plans are in place for iterative improvement up to 95%+ if needed.**
