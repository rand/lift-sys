## Component Status

### Phase 1: Natural Language → NIR (Uncertain)

**What It Does:** Parse natural language → Named Intermediate Representation

**Status:** ⚠️ UNCERTAIN
- Basic functionality works (prompts translate to IR)
- XGrammar constrained generation status unclear
- Recent llguidance migration attempts suggest issues

**Evidence:**
- 100% compilation suggests IR structure is valid
- 20% execution failures suggest semantic issues
- Model experiments (bigger instances, different models) indicate problems

**Known Gaps (27 Beads issues with phase-1 label):**
- Issues represent incomplete features, not completed work
- Many edge cases not handled
- Validation gaps

### Phase 2: NIR Validation (Partially Working)

**What It Does:** Validate IR structure and semantics

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Structure validation works (Pydantic models catch malformed IR)
- Semantic validation incomplete

**Evidence:**
- IR successfully validates for 10/10 test cases (100%)
- But 2/10 produce incorrect code (semantic validation gaps)

**Known Gaps (18 Beads issues with phase-2 label):**
- Many validation rules not implemented
- Edge case handling missing

### Phase 3: NIR → Code Generation (Mostly Working)

**What It Does:** Generate Python code from IR

**Status:** ✅ MOSTLY WORKING
- TemplatedCodeGenerator produces syntactically valid Python (100%)
- Generated code compiles (100%)
- 80% of generated code executes correctly

**Evidence:**
- Compilation: 10/10
- Execution: 8/10
- AST validation passes

**Known Issues:**
- Off-by-one errors (find_index)
- Type handling gaps (get_type_name)
- Edge case logic (is_valid_email)

**Known Gaps (21 Beads issues with phase-3 label):**
- Code generation patterns incomplete
- Some IR constructs not supported

### Phase 4: AST-Level Repair (✅ Working)

**What It Does:** Detect and repair syntax errors in generated code

**Status:** ✅ WORKING
- Successfully detects syntax errors
- AST node reconstruction functional
- Repair strategies effective

**Evidence:**
- Tests passing
- Used in production pipeline
- Documented in `docs/phases/PHASE_4_COMPLETE.md`

**Known Gaps (20 Beads issues with phase-4 label):**
- Advanced repair strategies not implemented
- Some AST patterns not covered

### Phase 5: Assertion Checking (✅ Working)

**What It Does:** Validate runtime assertions and constraints

**Status:** ✅ WORKING
- Assertion detection functional
- Constraint verification working
- Integration with validation pipeline

**Evidence:**
- Tests passing
- Successfully catches assertion violations
- Documented in phase completion reports

**Known Gaps (18 Beads issues with phase-5 label):**
- Some assertion types not covered
- Performance optimization needed

### Phase 6: Symbolic Execution (Uncertain)

**What It Does:** Symbolic analysis of generated code

**Status:** ⚠️ UNCERTAIN
- Implementation exists
- Test coverage unclear
- Integration with pipeline unclear

**Known Gaps (15 Beads issues with phase-6 label):**
- Many features incomplete
- Unclear what's functional

### Phase 7: IR-Level Constraints (✅ Mostly Working)

**What It Does:** Constraint satisfaction at IR level

**Status:** ✅ MOSTLY WORKING
- 87/89 tests passing (97.8%)
- Three constraint types implemented and functional
- Integration with pipeline working

**Evidence:**
- High test pass rate
- ReturnConstraint, LoopBehaviorConstraint, PositionConstraint proven
- Documented in `docs/phases/PHASE_7_COMPLETE.md`

**Known Gaps (9 Beads issues with phase-7 label):**
- 2 failing tests
- Additional constraint types not implemented

### Phase 8: Learning and Optimization (Not Started)

**Status:** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Planning done
- No implementation

**Known Gaps (6 Beads issues with phase-8 label):**
- Everything - this phase is queued

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why 20% Execution Failures?

**Hypothesis 1: XGrammar Issues**
- Constrained generation may not be working correctly
- Evidence: llguidance migration attempts, model experiments
- Impact: Semantic correctness of generated IR

**Hypothesis 2: IR → Code Translation Gaps**
- Some IR constructs translate incorrectly
- Evidence: Specific, repeatable failures (find_index, get_type_name)
- Impact: Logic errors in generated code

**Hypothesis 3: Validation Gaps**
- IR passes validation but has semantic issues
- Evidence: Valid IR produces invalid code
- Impact: Bugs reach code generation

**Likely Reality:** All three contribute

### Why 132 Open Phase Issues?

These represent **known gaps** discovered during implementation:
- Features designed but not implemented
- Edge cases not handled
- Integration points missing
- Performance optimizations needed

**NOT completed work** - they're TODOs for backend completeness

## Persistent Failures Detail

### 1. find_index - Off-by-One Error

**Function:** Find index of element in list

**Expected:**
```python
find_index([1, 2, 3], 2) → 1
```

**Actual:** Returns incorrect index (off-by-one)

**Root Cause:** IR generation or code template issue with index calculation

**Status:** Documented in `docs/testing/PERSISTENT_FAILURES_ANALYSIS.md`, not fixed

### 2. get_type_name - Type Handling

**Function:** Get name of Python type

**Expected:**
```python
get_type_name(int) → "int"
get_type_name(str) → "str"
```

**Actual:** Incorrect type name handling

**Root Cause:** IR type representation or code generation gap

**Status:** Documented, not fixed

### 3. is_valid_email - Edge Cases

**Function:** Validate email address

**Expected:** Handle all RFC-compliant emails

**Actual:** Fails on edge cases (special characters, internationalization)

**Root Cause:** Incomplete validation logic in generated code

**Status:** Documented, not fixed (though function_name_fix improved it)

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Pre-ICS)
1. Investigate XGrammar status - is it actually working?
2. Fix 3 persistent failures (find_index, get_type_name, is_valid_email)
3. Run full test suite to establish baseline

### Short-term (During ICS Phase 1)
1. Use ICS diagnostics to identify additional backend issues
2. Create targeted tests for failures discovered via ICS
3. Prioritize backend-gap issues based on ICS needs

### Medium-term (Post-ICS Phase 1)
1. Systematic review of 132 backend-gap issues
2. Categorize by: blocking ICS features, performance, nice-to-have
3. Address in priority order

### Long-term (Backend Enhancements)
1. DSPy architecture (systematic LLM orchestration)
2. ACE enhancement (advanced code evolution)
3. MUSLR enhancement (multi-stage reasoning)

## Beads Issue Breakdown by Phase

**Phase 0:** 1 issue (infrastructure)
**Phase 1:** 27 issues (NLP → IR gaps)
**Phase 2:** 18 issues (validation gaps)
**Phase 3:** 21 issues (code generation gaps)
**Phase 4:** 20 issues (AST repair enhancements)
**Phase 5:** 18 issues (assertion checking gaps)
**Phase 6:** 15 issues (symbolic execution)
**Phase 7:** 9 issues (constraint satisfaction gaps)
**Phase 8:** 6 issues (learning/optimization, not started)

**Total:** 132 issues labeled with `backend-gap`

All issues also retain their original `phase-X` labels for categorization.

## Conclusion

**Honest Assessment:**
- Core pipeline works (100% compilation, 80% execution)
- Significant gaps remain (132 open issues, 3 persistent failures)
- XGrammar status uncertain (needs investigation)
- ICS will serve as diagnostic tool to identify what's really broken

**Path Forward:**
- ICS as primary UI (not replacement for backend work)
- Backend stabilization parallel to ICS implementation
- Systematic gap closure driven by ICS insights

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: ICS Phase 1 implementation (8-10 days)
- Week 2-3: Backend stabilization (fix failures, investigate XGrammar)
- Week 4+: Systematic gap closure based on ICS diagnostics
