## Key Findings

### Strategic Value

**DoWhy + lift-sys = Unique Capability**
- **No competitor has this**: Causal inference for code analysis
- **Enables new questions**:
  - "What code is affected if I change function X?"
  - "Why did this function return value Y?"
  - "What would happen if I refactor module Z?"
- **Immediate ROI**: Impact analysis, test generation users need now

### Technical Feasibility

**HIGH Confidence**
- ✅ DoWhy installed and working (Python 3.11 venv)
- ✅ Core capabilities verified (graphs, SCM, interventions)
- ✅ Performance acceptable (ms-scale for 1000s of samples)
- ✅ Integration points clear (NetworkX already in use)
- ✅ Risks identified and mitigated

**Python 3.13 Workaround**
- Issue: cvxpy (DoWhy dependency) incompatible with Python 3.13
- Solution: Separate Python 3.11 venv via `uv` (proven working)
- Impact: Minimal (subprocess communication, ~100ms overhead)

### Implementation Estimate

**7 weeks total** (35 days):
- **Weeks 1-4**: P1 (Reverse Mode Enhancement)
  - Causal graph builder
  - SCM fitting (static + dynamic)
  - Intervention engine
  - IR integration
  - Testing & documentation
- **Weeks 5-7**: P2 (Test Generation)
  - Causal path extraction
  - Test case generation
  - Integration & validation
  - Testing & documentation

**Team Size**: 1 engineer (some parallelization possible)

## Risks & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

**STEP-03 (Data Flow Analysis)**: Complex AST traversal
- **Mitigation**: Use simpler heuristics if needed
- **Fallback**: Function calls only (lower accuracy, functional)

**STEP-07 (Execution Tracing)**: Runtime instrumentation
- **Mitigation**: Static-only mode as fallback
- **Impact**: Lower accuracy, but usable

**STEP-13 (SCM Serialization)**: Complex data structures
- **Mitigation**: Recompute on load (slower, functional)

**STEP-16 (Accuracy Validation)**: Requires manual review
- **Plan**: Allocate extra time, iterate if needed
- **Timeline Impact**: +1-2 days buffer

### Contingency Budget

**Built into plan**: 7 weeks includes buffer
- **Optimistic**: 5 weeks (all goes well)
- **Realistic**: 6-7 weeks (some issues)
- **Pessimistic**: 8-9 weeks (significant issues)
