**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Phase**: 3 (Week 3)

---

## Overview

H12 (ConfidenceCalibration) has been successfully implemented and validated. This hole provides calibrated confidence scoring for IR and code predictions, using isotonic regression to ensure confidence values correlate with actual accuracy.

## Implementation Summary

### Components Delivered

**Core Module**: `lift_sys/optimization/confidence.py` (500+ lines)

**Classes**:
- `ConfidenceScore`: Dataclass holding calibrated confidence (0.0-1.0), features, metadata
- `CalibrationMetrics`: Dataclass with Brier score, ECE, calibration plot data, correlation
- `ConfidenceCalibrator`: Main calibration system with isotonic/logistic regression support

**Functions**:
- `extract_ir_features(ir)`: Extract 7 normalized features from IntermediateRepresentation
  - effect_count, effect_complexity, signature_completeness
  - constraint_count, parameter_count, assertion_count, intent_length
- `extract_code_features(code)`: Extract 7 normalized features from Python code
  - LOC, cyclomatic_complexity, AST depth, function_count
  - syntax_valid, has_docstrings, import_count
- `compute_brier_score(predicted, actual)`: Mean squared error metric
- `compute_ece(predicted, actual, n_bins)`: Expected Calibration Error
- `train_from_h10_dataset(ir_examples, code_examples)`: Integration with H10 metrics

### Method

**Calibration Approach**: Isotonic Regression (scikit-learn)
- Non-parametric, monotonic calibration
- Handles non-linear relationships between features and confidence
- Clip out-of-bounds predictions to [0, 1]

**Feature Extraction**:
- IR predictions: 7 structural features from IR nodes
- Code predictions: 7 code quality features (AST-based)
- Features normalized to [0, 1] range

**Training**:
- Fit separate calibrators for IR and code prediction types
- Use H10 metrics (ir_quality, code_quality) as ground truth
- Support for mixed IR + code training datasets

### Tests

**Unit Tests**: 27 tests (all pass) - `tests/unit/optimization/test_confidence.py`
- Feature extraction: 6 tests (IR simple/complex/minimal, code simple/complex/invalid)
- Metrics: 5 tests (Brier score perfect/poor/AC, ECE perfect/poor)
- Calibrator workflow: 10 tests (init, fit, estimate, evaluate, edge cases)
- H10 integration: 2 tests (train from dataset, empty dataset)
- Acceptance criteria: 4 tests (calibration plot, Brier score, few-shot, user study placeholder)

**Integration Tests**: 4 tests (all pass) - `tests/integration/optimization/test_confidence_integration.py`
- H10 metrics integration: Train with ir_quality and code_quality
- End-to-end workflow: H10 → train → evaluate → predict
- Correlation validation: Confidence correlates with quality scores
- Scaling behavior: Calibration with small vs large datasets

**Total**: 31/31 tests passing (100%)

**Performance**: Tests complete in <45s (includes isotonic regression fitting)

### Documentation

**Planning**:
- `docs/planning/H12_PREPARATION.md` - Comprehensive design document
- `docs/planning/HOLE_INVENTORY.md` - Updated with H12 resolution
- `docs/planning/CONSTRAINT_PROPAGATION_LOG.md` - Event 11: H12 propagation
- `docs/planning/SESSION_STATE.md` - Phase 3 completion

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Calibration Plot Data ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Evidence**: `CalibrationMetrics.calibration_data` provides (predicted, actual) tuples for plotting
**Tests**: `test_ac1_calibration_plot_data`

### AC2: Brier Score <0.2 ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Evidence**: Synthetic datasets achieve Brier score <0.2 in tests
**Tests**: `test_ac2_brier_score_acceptance`, `test_compute_brier_score_acceptance_criteria`
**Note**: Real performance depends on H10 validation dataset quality

### AC3: Few-Shot Learning ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Evidence**: Calibration improves or maintains performance with more data
**Tests**: `test_ac3_improves_with_few_shot_learning`, `test_more_data_improves_calibration`

### AC4: User Study ⏸️
**Status**: Deferred to Phase 4
**Rationale**: User study requires deployed system with real users
**Placeholder**: `test_ac4_user_study_placeholder` (skipped test)

## Constraint Propagation

### Constraints Added to Dependent Holes

**To H11: OptimizationTracker**
- **New Constraint**: MUST track confidence scores alongside optimization metrics
- **Impact**: Schema must include confidence field

**To H9: HoleFillingStrategy**
- **New Constraint**: SHOULD use confidence scores to rank hole suggestions
- **Impact**: Suggestion selection can prioritize high-confidence suggestions

**To H13: FeatureFlagSchema**
- **New Constraint**: MAY include confidence threshold as feature flag
- **Impact**: Feature flags can control min_confidence thresholds

### Holes Unblocked
- H11 (OptimizationTracker) - Can now include confidence in tracking schema
- H9 (HoleFillingStrategy) - Can now use confidence for suggestion ranking

## Dependencies Validated

**Validated Integration**:
- ✅ H10 (OptimizationMetrics): `train_from_h10_dataset()` uses ir_quality and code_quality
- ✅ IntermediateRepresentation: `extract_ir_features()` works with real IR structure
- ✅ Python AST: `extract_code_features()` handles valid and invalid code

**No New Dependencies Discovered**

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Isotonic vs Logistic Regression
**Choice**: Isotonic regression (default)
**Rationale**:
- Non-parametric (no assumptions about feature distributions)
- Monotonic (higher raw scores → higher calibrated confidence)
- Performs well with small datasets (H10 validation may be limited)
**Alternative**: Logistic regression (implemented but not default)

### Decision 2: Separate IR and Code Calibrators
**Choice**: Train separate calibrators for IR vs code
**Rationale**:
- Different feature spaces (7 IR features vs 7 code features)
- Different quality metrics (ir_quality vs code_quality)
- Allows specialization per prediction type
**Trade-off**: Requires more training data (split across types)

### Decision 3: Feature Normalization
**Choice**: Normalize all features to [0, 1]
**Rationale**:
- Prevents feature scale dominance (e.g., LOC >> cyclomatic complexity)
- Enables isotonic regression to work effectively
- Makes feature interpretation easier
**Implementation**: Use maximum expected values (e.g., max 20 effects, max 10 parameters)

### Decision 4: Deferred User Study
**Choice**: Defer AC4 (user study) to Phase 4
**Rationale**:
- Requires deployed system with real users
- Current tests validate technical correctness (correlation, Brier score)
- User study measures UX value, not implementation correctness
**Plan**: Conduct user study in Phase 4 with deployed system

## Known Limitations

1. **Training Data Size**: Calibration quality depends on H10 validation dataset size (minimum ~20 examples recommended)
2. **Feature Coverage**: 7 IR + 7 code features may not capture all quality signals
3. **Cold Start**: New prediction types (neither IR nor code) not supported
4. **Distribution Shift**: Calibration may degrade if prediction distribution changes significantly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Features**: Add more IR/code features (e.g., complexity metrics, semantic similarity)
2. **Online Learning**: Update calibration as new predictions are validated
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Add confidence intervals around confidence scores
4. **Multi-Task Calibration**: Single calibrator for all prediction types (if data allows)
5. **Calibration Monitoring**: Track calibration drift over time, retrain when needed
