# Strategic Assessment: lift-sys Path Forward

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Status**: Diagnostic Investigation Phase
**Beads**: lift-sys-229 (P0)

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 7 (IR-level constraints) completed with excellent architecture (97.8% test coverage, comprehensive documentation) but **zero real-world impact** on success rate. We remain at **83.3% (15/18 tests)** - same as Phase 6.

**Decision**: Pause feature development, investigate root cause of 3 persistent failures, then make data-driven decision on next approach.

---

## Current State

### What's Working ✅

1. **Core Pipeline** (Phase 1-3)
   - End-to-end proven: Prompt → IR → Code
   - Modal inference operational
   - 83.3% baseline success rate (15/18 tests)

2. **Phase 4: AST Repair**
   - 7 passes, 100% unit test pass rate
   - Successfully fixes 4/18 tests
   - Logic correct, patterns brittle

3. **Phase 7: IR Constraints**
   - 3 constraint types implemented
   - Automatic detection working
   - AST validation functioning
   - 97.8% test coverage
   - **But: Zero impact on real-world failures**

### What's Not Working ❌

1. **Phase 7 Had No Impact**
   - Before: 15/18 passing (83.3%)
   - After: 15/18 passing (83.3%)
   - Same 3 failures persist

2. **The 3 Persistent Failures**
   - **count_words**: Returns None (missing return)
     - ReturnConstraint exists
     - AST Pass 7 targets this
     - **Still fails**

   - **find_index**: Returns last instead of first (accumulation bug)
     - LoopBehaviorConstraint(FIRST_MATCH, EARLY_RETURN) exists
     - AST Pass 8 targets this
     - **Still fails**

   - **is_valid_email**: Accepts 'test@.com' (adjacency bug)
     - PositionConstraint(NOT_ADJACENT) exists
     - AST Pass 6 targets this
     - **Still fails**

3. **Pattern Matching Brittleness**
   - Patterns work in isolation (100% unit tests)
   - Patterns miss in integration (83.3% real-world)
   - LLM generates code structure variations
   - Best-of-N increases variation

### Core Problem

**We're building upstream validation (constraints, semantic analysis) while the downstream bottleneck (AST pattern brittleness) remains unsolved.**

```
Phase 7 Constraints → LLM generates code → AST Repair (brittle) → Still fails
✅ Working            ✅ Working            ❌ BOTTLENECK
```

**Insight**: Constraints guide generation and catch violations, but LLM still generates incorrect code structure variations that AST repair patterns don't match.

## Recommended Plan: 2-Week Investigation & Fix

### Week 1: Diagnostic Investigation (lift-sys-229)

**Goal**: Understand WHY the 3 failures resist all approaches

**Tasks**:
1. **Monday-Tuesday**: Deep diagnostic
   - Collect 10+ code samples per test (different temperatures)
   - Analyze AST structure patterns
   - Map constraint detection/validation flow
   - Review LLM feedback quality

2. **Wednesday-Thursday**: Effectiveness analysis
   - Measure where pipeline breaks for each failure
   - Identify common patterns
   - Assess feasibility of targeted fixes

3. **Friday**: Decision point
   - Present findings
   - Recommend specific solution
   - Get approval for Week 2

**Deliverable**: `DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT_3_FAILURES.md` with root cause and recommendation

**Success**: Clear understanding + data-driven recommendation

### Week 2: Implementation

**Based on Week 1 findings, choose:**

**If constraint detection is the issue:**
- Refine detection rules
- Add more specific patterns
- Improve NLP parsing

**If validation is the issue:**
- Implement semantic property checking (Option 2 lite)
- Add test execution for critical constraints
- Compare actual behavior vs expected

**If LLM understanding is the issue:**
- Enhance error message quality
- Add correct/incorrect code examples
- Improve feedback specificity

**If pattern matching is fundamentally broken:**
- Implement LLM-based repair (Option 4)
- Or pivot to semantic validation (Option 2)

## Strategic Options Available

### Option 1: Diagnostic Investigation (RECOMMENDED - 1 week)

**Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE** (lift-sys-229)

**Why first**: We're shooting in the dark without data on where pipeline actually breaks.

### Option 2: Semantic Validation (3-4 weeks)

**Approach**: Check actual behavior, not AST structure
- Generate test cases from constraints
- Execute code with known inputs
- Validate outputs match expected behavior
- Works for ANY code structure

**Pros**: Robust to variations, validates correctness not structure
**Cons**: Requires test execution (slower), sandbox safety
**Alignment**: Phase 5 (IR Interpreter) + Phase 6 (Abstract Validator)

### Option 3: Constraint Propagation / CSP (6-8 weeks)

**Approach**: Treat IR generation as CSP with typed holes

**Pros**: Mathematically principled, future-proof
**Cons**: Large effort, doesn't directly address current failures
**Assessment**: Elegant but not aligned with current problem

### Option 4: LLM-Based Repair (2-3 weeks)

**Approach**: Use LLM to suggest fixes based on test failures

**Pros**: Handles novel bugs, scales with LLM capability
**Cons**: Slower, costs more, less deterministic
**Note**: ValidatedCodeGenerator already does this, may need refinement

### Option 5: Pause and Reassess (1 week)

**Questions**:
- Is 83.3% actually good enough?
- Are we optimizing for wrong metric?
- Is LLM capability the bottleneck?
- Should we focus on different problems?

---

## Critical Assessment

### Challenge 1: Are We Solving the Right Problem?

**Current**: Build validation to catch bugs after generation

**Alternative**: Better IR specifications upfront?
- More explicit intent
- Better examples in prompts
- Clearer effect descriptions

**Evidence**: LLM CAN generate correct code (diagnostics show 5/5 for count_words), suggesting prompt/IR quality matters more than validation.

### Challenge 2: Is Pattern Matching Fundamentally Flawed?

**Yes.** Phase 6 identified this. Phase 7 built constraints but didn't address core brittleness.

**Recommendation**: Either fix pattern matching (semantic validation) or abandon it (LLM-based repair). Don't keep layering on top.

### Challenge 3: Are We Feature Creeping?

**Timeline**:
- Week 1 (Oct 15): E2E proof ✅
- Week 2: Phase 7 constraints (no impact)
- Week 3: Documentation and polish

**Question**: Did we need Phase 7 at all? Could we have hit 90%+ by refining ValidatedCodeGenerator and adding semantic validation?

**Answer**: Phase 7 architecture good for future (CSP, typed holes) but may have been premature optimization.

## Decision Criteria for Week 2

After Week 1 diagnostic:

- **If diagnostic shows clear fix** → Implement fix
- **If diagnostic shows fundamental limit** → Reassess approach (Option 5)
- **If diagnostic inconclusive** → Try Option 2 (semantic validation)

---

## Concrete Next Steps

1. ✅ **Created**: Beads work item (lift-sys-229, P0)
2. ✅ **Created**: Diagnostic collection script (`debug/collect_failure_samples.py`)
3. ✅ **Created**: Todo list tracking (11 tasks)
4. **Next**: Run diagnostic collection (36 samples: 12 per test)
5. **Then**: Analyze data and write diagnostic report
6. **Then**: Present findings for Week 2 decision

## Final Thought

We have **228 Beads work items**, multiple sophisticated architectures planned, and excellent documentation. But we're **stuck at 83.3%** with the same 3 failures that have resisted 3 different fix attempts.

**Either** these failures are fundamentally hard (move on)
**Or** we're approaching them wrong (investigate and pivot)

**Recommendation**: Investigate first, pivot second, build sophisticated architecture third.

**Status**: Ready to begin diagnostic investigation (Week 1)
**First milestone**: Diagnostic report by end of week
**Success metric**: Data-driven recommendation for Week 2
