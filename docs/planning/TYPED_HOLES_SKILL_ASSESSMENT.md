# Typed Holes Refactor Skill: Applicability Assessment

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Context**: E2E Validation Plan - Replacing mocks with real Modal integration
**Skill**: `~/.claude/skills/typed-holes-refactor/SKILL.md`

---

## Executive Summary

**Question**: Is the typed-holes-refactor skill useful for the E2E validation work?

**Answer**: **Partially useful** - Some concepts apply, but it's NOT the primary framework.

**Recommendation**: **Borrow concepts, don't use the full workflow**

---

## What is Typed Holes Refactoring?

The skill provides a systematic methodology for refactoring existing code by:
1. **Discovering holes** in the current system (architectural unknowns)
2. **Writing characterization tests** to capture exact current behavior
3. **Resolving holes iteratively** with test-driven validation
4. **Propagating constraints** through dependency graphs
5. **Never breaking baseline** - tests must always pass

**Key principle**: Treat architectural unknowns as "typed holes" and resolve them systematically while preserving existing behavior.

## Applicability to E2E Validation

### ❌ NOT Applicable (Core Workflow)

The typed-holes-refactor workflow is designed for **refactoring existing code**, but our task is **validation of already-implemented architecture**:

| Typed-Holes Workflow | Our E2E Task | Match? |
|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| Discover new architectural holes | Holes already defined (H1-H19 in HOLE_INVENTORY.md) | ❌ No |
| Refactor existing implementation | Validate existing implementation against real infrastructure | ❌ No |
| Preserve current behavior | Replace mocked behavior with real behavior (intentional change) | ❌ No |
| Write characterization tests for existing code | Write integration tests for real Modal calls | ❌ No |

**Conclusion**: The full typed-holes-refactor workflow does NOT fit this task.

---

### ✅ Applicable Concepts

While the full workflow doesn't apply, several **concepts are valuable**:

#### 1. Characterization Tests = Baseline Benchmarks

**Typed-holes concept**:
```python
# tests/characterization/test_current_behavior.py
def test_performance_baselines():
    """Record current performance - don't regress"""
    baselines = measure_all_operations()
    save_json("baselines.json", baselines)
```

**Our equivalent** (Phase 1.3):
```bash
# Measure baseline performance with 32B model
./scripts/benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh --real-modal
# Document in docs/benchmarks/BASELINE_32B_20251022.md
```

**How it helps**: Establish a performance baseline before making changes, then validate no regressions.

---

#### 2. Test-Driven Validation

**Typed-holes concept**:
```python
# Write tests BEFORE implementing resolution
def test_h{N}_resolved():
    """Define what 'resolved correctly' means"""
    # This should FAIL initially
    assert desired_state_achieved()
```

**Our equivalent** (Phase 2-4):
```python
# tests/integration/test_modal_provider_real.py
@pytest.mark.real_modal
async def test_modal_provider_xgrammar_constrained():
    """Test real Modal endpoint with XGrammar constraints."""
    provider = ModalProvider()
    # ... test implementation
```

**How it helps**: Write integration tests before running them, making expectations explicit.

---

#### 3. Dependency Order Resolution

**Typed-holes concept**:
```bash
# Resolve holes in dependency order
python scripts/next_hole.py
# Shows holes whose dependencies are resolved
```

**Our equivalent** (Phase 3.2):
- Test critical path first: **H6 → H1 → H10 → H8 → H17**
- These holes block the most downstream work
- Validate in dependency order to catch issues early

**How it helps**: Prioritize work by dependency graph, not arbitrary order.

---

#### 4. Formal Completeness Criteria

**Typed-holes concept**:
- All holes resolved and validated
- All constraints satisfied
- All phase gates passed
- Metrics improved or maintained

**Our equivalent** (E2E Validation Success Criteria):
- ✅ 100% of integration tests use real Modal
- ✅ Performance meets baseline (47s p50, 100% success)
- ✅ XGrammar validated for all IR schemas
- ✅ Observability in place
- ✅ No test regressions

**How it helps**: Define explicit completion criteria upfront, not subjective "looks good."

---

#### 5. Constraint Propagation

**Typed-holes concept**:
```bash
# After resolving a hole, propagate constraints
python scripts/propagate.py H{N}
# Updates dependent holes based on resolution
```

**Our equivalent** (Phase 6.1):
- When a hole fails validation with real Modal, document the gap
- Propagate constraints to dependent holes (e.g., if H1 fails, H8/H10 may also fail)
- Update MOCK_TO_REAL_GAPS.md with discovered constraints

**How it helps**: Systematically track how failures in one component affect others.

---

## Borrowed Concepts in E2E Plan

The E2E Validation Plan already incorporates these typed-holes concepts:

### Phase 1: Baseline Measurement (Characterization)
- **Typed-holes equivalent**: Characterization tests
- **Our implementation**: Run benchmarks with real Modal, document baseline performance
- **Files**: `docs/benchmarks/BASELINE_32B_20251022.md`

### Phase 2-4: Test-Driven Integration
- **Typed-holes equivalent**: Write tests before implementing
- **Our implementation**: Create integration tests for real Modal before running them
- **Files**: `tests/integration/test_modal_provider_real.py`, `test_provider_adapter_real.py`

### Phase 3.2: Critical Path First
- **Typed-holes equivalent**: Resolve in dependency order
- **Our implementation**: Test H6 → H1 → H10 → H8 → H17 before other holes
- **Rationale**: These holes block the most downstream work

### Phase 6: Gap Analysis and Constraint Propagation
- **Typed-holes equivalent**: Document constraint propagation
- **Our implementation**: `MOCK_TO_REAL_GAPS.md` documents how real system diverges from mocked
- **Constraint propagation**: When Modal fails, update dependent hole expectations

### Success Criteria: Formal Completeness
- **Typed-holes equivalent**: Design complete when all criteria met
- **Our implementation**: 5 quantitative + 3 qualitative success metrics (Appendix C)

## Concepts NOT Used (And Why)

### 1. Hole Discovery Scripts
**Typed-holes**: `python scripts/discover_holes.py` auto-discovers holes

**Why not used**: Holes already cataloged in `HOLE_INVENTORY.md` (H1-H19). We're validating existing holes, not discovering new ones.

---

### 2. Refactor IR Document
**Typed-holes**: `REFACTOR_IR.md` documents architectural unknowns

**Why not used**: We have `HOLE_INVENTORY.md` and `SESSION_STATE.md` which serve this purpose.

---

### 3. Characterization Tests for Behavior Preservation
**Typed-holes**: Tests ensure refactored code behaves identically to original

**Why not used**: We're **intentionally changing behavior** (mocked → real Modal calls). The behavior should NOT be identical.

---

### 4. Safe Refactor Branch
**Typed-holes**: Work only in `refactor/typed-holes-v1` branch, main is read-only

**Why not used**: This is standard practice (feature branches), not specific to typed-holes methodology.

---

## Recommendation

### Use These Concepts
1. ✅ **Baseline measurement** before changes (Phase 1.3)
2. ✅ **Test-driven validation** - write tests before running them
3. ✅ **Dependency order** - critical path first (H6→H1→H10→H8→H17)
4. ✅ **Formal completeness** - explicit success criteria (Appendix C)
5. ✅ **Gap documentation** - track failures and constraint propagation (Phase 6)

### Don't Use These
1. ❌ Full typed-holes-refactor workflow (wrong use case)
2. ❌ Hole discovery scripts (holes already known)
3. ❌ Behavior preservation tests (intentional behavior change)
4. ❌ REFACTOR_IR.md (we have HOLE_INVENTORY.md)

---

## Conclusion

**Verdict**: The typed-holes-refactor skill is **conceptually valuable** but **not directly applicable** to this task.

**What we're doing**: Validating an already-implemented architecture against real infrastructure (not refactoring)

**What to borrow**:
- Baseline measurement (characterization)
- Test-driven validation
- Dependency-ordered work
- Formal completion criteria
- Gap analysis and constraint propagation

**What to skip**:
- Full workflow (hole discovery, behavior preservation, refactor branches)

**Bottom line**: The E2E Validation Plan already incorporates the valuable concepts from typed-holes-refactor without adopting the full methodology.

**Status**: Assessment complete
**Next**: Proceed with E2E Validation Plan (Phase 1 ready to start)
