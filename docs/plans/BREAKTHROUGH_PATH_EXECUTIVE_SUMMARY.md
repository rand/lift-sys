# Breaking the 80% Barrier: Executive Summary
## State-of-the-Art Research Synthesis for Lift-Sys

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Current Performance**: 8/10 (80%)
**Target**: 9.5/10 (95%+)

## The Problem

We've hit a **hard ceiling at 80% success rate**. Despite implementing:
- ✅ AST-based validation (detects bugs correctly)
- ✅ Comprehensive IR hole clearing (multishot works)
- ✅ Temperature-varied multishot (generates diverse candidates)

The system still fails on the same 2 tests every time.

**Root Cause Discovery**: The barrier is NOT technical infrastructure - it's **IR specification insufficiency**.

The LLM receives prompts like "After the loop ends (not inside it), return -1" but still generates code with `return -1` inside the loop. Text descriptions alone are **insufficient** to convey precise control flow semantics.

---

## State-of-the-Art Research: Key Breakthroughs

### 1. **IRCoder (ACL 2024)**: Concrete Examples Beat Text Descriptions

**Finding**: Compiler intermediate representations with concrete syntax dramatically improve generation.

**Application**: Add **code examples** to our IR:
```python
# Instead of: "return -1 after loop completes"
# Include:
"""
for index, item in enumerate(lst):
    if item == value:
        return index
return -1  # <-- AFTER loop (at this indentation)
"""
```

**Expected Gain**: +5% (80% → 85%)

### 2. **LLM-SMT Integration (2024-2025)**: Formal Verification = 100% Correctness

**Finding**: Combining LLMs with Z3 SMT solver achieved **100% coverage** (133/133) on Code2Inv benchmark.

**How It Works**:
1. LLM generates code
2. Z3 proves control flow properties (e.g., "fallback return only after loop completes")
3. If proof fails → code is wrong → regenerate or repair

**Application**: Use Z3 to **verify** instead of just detect:
```python
# SMT formula: ∀ executions: fallback_return ⟹ loop_completed
solver.add(Implies(fallback_executed, loop_completed))
if solver.check() != sat:
    # Proof failed: code is buggy
```

**Expected Gain**: +5% (85% → 90%)

### 3. **AST-Based Auto-Repair (2024)**: Fix Don't Retry

**Finding**: Direct AST transformations can fix bugs that LLMs can't understand from text feedback.

**Application**: When validation detects "return inside loop", **automatically move it**:
```python
# Detected:
for i in lst:
    if condition:
        return value
    return -1  # ← BUG

# Auto-repair to:
for i in lst:
    if condition:
        return value
return -1  # ← FIXED
```

**Expected Gain**: +3% (90% → 93%)

### 4. **CEGIS (Counter-Example Guided Synthesis)**: Learn from Failures

**Finding**: Iterative refinement with counterexamples achieves near-perfect results.

**How It Works**:
1. Generate code → test
2. Collect failing test cases as counterexamples
3. Use LLM to refine IR based on what went wrong
4. Regenerate with refined IR
5. Repeat 3-5 times

**Application**: Implement CEGIS loop that refines IR specifications based on empirical failures.

**Expected Gain**: +2-5% (93% → 95%+)

## Four-Phase Improvement Roadmap

### **Phase 4: Concrete Examples in IR** (Week 1)
**What**: Add code examples to IR effects
**Why**: LLMs learn better from examples than descriptions
**Expected**: 80% → 85%

**Implementation**:
- Build pattern library with 5-10 common examples (loops, searches, filters)
- Enhance IR to include `examples` field with concrete code
- Update code generation prompts to reference examples

**Effort**: 3-5 days

---

### **Phase 5: SMT-Based Verification** (Week 2)
**What**: Use Z3 SMT solver to prove control flow correctness
**Why**: Formal proofs catch bugs that validation misses
**Expected**: 85% → 90%

**Implementation**:
- Install `z3-solver`
- Create `ControlFlowVerifier` that models control flow in Z3
- Verify properties like "return only after loop" before accepting code
- Reject code if SMT proof fails

**Effort**: 5-7 days

---

### **Phase 6: AST Auto-Repair** (Week 3)
**What**: Automatically fix detected bugs via AST transformation
**Why**: Fix is faster and more reliable than retry
**Expected**: 90% → 93%

**Implementation**:
- Create `ASTRepairEngine` with 3-5 repair patterns
- Pattern 1: Move return from inside loop to after loop
- Pattern 2: Add missing fallback return
- Pattern 3: Fix if-elif-else missing branches
- Integrate with validation pipeline (repair before retry)

**Effort**: 5-7 days

---

### **Phase 7: CEGIS Loop** (Week 4)
**What**: Iterative refinement using test failures to improve IR
**Why**: Learn from mistakes to improve specifications
**Expected**: 93% → 95%+

**Implementation**:
- Extract counterexamples from failing tests
- Use LLM to analyze failures and refine IR
- Regenerate with refined IR
- Repeat 3-5 iterations or until success

**Effort**: 5-7 days

## Expected Progression

| Week | Phase | Technique | Success Rate | Cumulative Gain |
|------|-------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **0** | Current | Multishot + Validation | **80%** | baseline |
| **1** | Phase 4 | + Concrete Examples | **85%** | +5% |
| **2** | Phase 5 | + SMT Verification | **90%** | +10% |
| **3** | Phase 6 | + AST Auto-Repair | **93%** | +13% |
| **4** | Phase 7 | + CEGIS Loop | **95%+** | +15%+ |

---

## Why This Will Work

### 1. **Evidence-Based**
Every technique is backed by 2024-2025 peer-reviewed research with demonstrated results:
- IRCoder: Published at ACL 2024
- LLM-SMT: 100% on Code2Inv benchmark
- AST Repair: Standard in program synthesis literature
- CEGIS: Proven technique from formal methods

### 2. **Incremental & Testable**
Each phase is independent and testable:
- Can measure exact improvement contribution
- Can rollback if phase doesn't work
- Low risk of breaking existing functionality

### 3. **Addresses Root Cause**
Not adding more infrastructure (we have enough) - improving **specification quality**:
- Examples make specifications concrete
- SMT makes specifications verifiable
- Repair makes specifications self-correcting
- CEGIS makes specifications adaptive

### 4. **Practical Implementation**
No need for:
- ❌ Fine-tuning models (too expensive)
- ❌ Massive compute (1M samples like AlphaCode)
- ❌ New programming languages

Just:
- ✅ Pattern library (manual but small)
- ✅ Z3 integration (well-documented library)
- ✅ AST transformations (Python stdlib)
- ✅ Iterative loops (already have infrastructure)

---

## Investment vs. Return

### Time Investment
- **Phase 4**: 3-5 days (example library)
- **Phase 5**: 5-7 days (SMT integration)
- **Phase 6**: 5-7 days (AST repair)
- **Phase 7**: 5-7 days (CEGIS loop)

**Total**: ~4 weeks for complete implementation

### Expected Return
- **15% absolute improvement** (80% → 95%)
- **75% reduction in failures** (2/10 → 0.5/10)
- **Formal correctness guarantees** (SMT proofs)
- **Self-repairing system** (AST auto-fix)

---

## Alternative Approaches (Why We're NOT Doing Them)

### ❌ Fine-tune on IR→Code Dataset (IRCoder approach)
- **Why not**: Requires 4M+ training examples + GPU compute
- **Our advantage**: Constrained generation already works, just needs better specs

### ❌ Type-Constrained Decoding
- **Why not**: Python's gradual typing makes this complex
- **Future**: Could add for statically-typed languages (Rust, Go)

### ❌ AlphaCode-style Massive Sampling
- **Why not**: 1M candidates = $$$ in API costs
- **Our advantage**: Smarter (verified, repaired) > more attempts

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| SMT solver overhead | Performance | Cache verification results, verify only complex patterns |
| AST repair introduces bugs | Correctness | Only apply repair if validation passes on result |
| CEGIS doesn't converge | Wasted time | Cap at 5 iterations, use best candidate |
| Examples don't generalize | Limited improvement | Build diverse library, semantic similarity matching |

---

## Success Metrics

### Primary
- **>95% test passing rate** on Phase 2 suite (currently 80%)
- **<3 retry attempts** on average (currently ~5)

### Secondary
- **100% verification pass rate** for SMT-verified code
- **>50% repair success rate** (fix without retry)
- **CEGIS convergence** in <5 iterations 80%+ of time

### Quality
- Generated code matches reference implementation control flow 90%+ of time
- No false positives from SMT verification
- Repairs preserve semantic correctness

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Phase 4 immediately**. It's:
- ✅ Low risk (just adding examples to IR)
- ✅ High value (+5% expected improvement)
- ✅ Quick to implement (3-5 days)
- ✅ Foundation for later phases

If Phase 4 delivers expected results, continue to Phase 5 (SMT verification).

Each phase builds on the previous, so we can stop at any point if we hit 95% earlier than expected.

## Questions to Address

1. **Priority**: Should we target 95% or aim higher (99%)?
2. **Scope**: Full 4-phase implementation or stop early if 95% achieved?
3. **Evaluation**: Expand test suite now or after Phase 4?
4. **Resources**: Dedicated time allocation for 4-week implementation?

---

**Bottom Line**: We know exactly why we're at 80% (vague IR specs) and we have a clear, research-backed path to 95%+ through concrete examples, formal verification, automatic repair, and iterative refinement.

The infrastructure is solid. Now we make the specifications solid too.
