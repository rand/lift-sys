- Effect estimation
- Quantifying causal influences
- What-if analysis (interventions)
- Root cause analysis
- Counterfactual generation
- Refutation/validation APIs

### Maintained By

- **PyWhy Ecosystem** (https://www.pywhy.org/)
- Active development (v0.13 released July 2025)
- Strong academic and industry backing (Microsoft Research origins)
- Excellent documentation and examples

---

## 2. Core Capabilities

### 2.1 Graphical Causal Models (GCM)

**Primary Module**: `dowhy.gcm`

**What it does**: Models systems as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where edges represent causal relationships.

**Key Classes**:
```python
from dowhy import gcm
import networkx as nx

# Create causal graph
causal_graph = nx.DiGraph([('X', 'Y'), ('Y', 'Z')])

# Create structural causal model
causal_model = gcm.StructuralCausalModel(causal_graph)
```

**Applications for lift-sys**:
- Model code as causal graph (functions → dependencies → outputs)
- Represent data flow in programs
- Capture control flow dependencies

### 2.2 Causal Mechanism Assignment

**Automatic Assignment**:
```python
gcm.auto.assign_causal_mechanisms(causal_model, data)
```

**Manual Assignment**:
```python
causal_model.set_causal_mechanism('X', gcm.EmpiricalDistribution())
causal_model.set_causal_mechanism('Y', gcm.AdditiveNoiseModel(
    gcm.ml.create_linear_regressor()
))
```

**Supported Mechanisms**:
- Empirical distributions (for root nodes)
- Additive noise models (ANM)
- Post-nonlinear models
- Custom Python functions

**Application for lift-sys**:
- Infer how code transforms data
- Model side effects and state changes
- Capture behavioral patterns from execution traces

### 2.3 Interventional Analysis

**Core Function**: `gcm.interventional_samples()`

**What it does**: Generates samples from the distribution P(Y | do(X=x)) - "what happens when we force X to value x?"

**Example**:
```python
# What happens if we force Y = 2.34?
intervention_samples = gcm.interventional_samples(
    causal_model,
    {'Y': lambda y: 2.34},
    num_samples_to_draw=1000
)
```

**Verified in testing**: Works accurately (expected Z=7.02, got mean Z=7.20)

**Application for lift-sys**:
- **Refactoring Impact**: "What happens if we change this function?"
- **Bug Fix Analysis**: "What variables are affected if we fix this line?"
- **Performance Optimization**: "What's the downstream impact of caching this?"

### 2.4 Counterfactual Analysis

**Capability**: Answer "what would have happened if..." questions

**DoWhy Support**:
- Counterfactual sample generation
- Retrospective analysis
- Causal attribution (why did Y happen given X?)

**Application for lift-sys**:
- **Debugging**: "What would the output be if input was X instead of Y?"
- **Test Case Generation**: "Generate inputs that would cause different behaviors"
- **Root Cause Analysis**: "Why did this function return error?"

### 2.5 Causal Effect Estimation

**Traditional DoWhy API** (for observational data):
```python
from dowhy import CausalModel

model = CausalModel(
    data=data,
    treatment='X',
    outcome='Y',
    graph=causal_graph
)

# 4-step process
identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()
estimate = model.estimate_effect(
    identified_estimand,
    method_name="backdoor.propensity_score_matching"
)
refute = model.refute_estimate(identified_estimand, estimate)
```

**Application for lift-sys**:
- Estimate "treatment effect" of code changes
- Control for confounders in performance analysis
- Validate assumptions about code behavior

---

## 3. API Patterns

### 3.1 Primary Workflow (GCM-based)

**Step 1: Define Causal Graph**
```python
import networkx as nx
causal_graph = nx.DiGraph([
    ('input', 'validate'),
    ('validate', 'process'),
    ('config', 'process'),
    ('process', 'output')
])
```

**Step 2: Create SCM**
```python
from dowhy import gcm
scm = gcm.StructuralCausalModel(causal_graph)
```

**Step 3: Fit to Data**
```python
gcm.auto.assign_causal_mechanisms(scm, data)
gcm.fit(scm, data)
```

**Step 4: Query**
```python
# Intervention
samples = gcm.interventional_samples(scm, {'X': value})

# Counterfactual (if implemented for model)
cf = gcm.counterfactual_samples(...)

# Attribution
attributions = gcm.attribute(...)
```

### 3.2 Data Requirements

**Format**: pandas DataFrame or dict of arrays

**Requirements**:
- Columns match node names in graph
- Sufficient samples for mechanism fitting (typically 100+)
- Can handle continuous and categorical variables

**For lift-sys**:
- **Static Analysis**: Use AST/call graph as "structure"
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Execution traces as "data"
- **Hybrid**: Combine both for robust models

### 3.3 NetworkX Integration

**DoWhy uses NetworkX for graphs**:
```python
import networkx as nx

# Create graph
G = nx.DiGraph()
G.add_edges_from([('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C')])

# Query graph
ancestors = nx.ancestors(G, 'C')  # {'A', 'B'}
descendants = nx.descendants(G, 'A')  # {'B', 'C'}
paths = list(nx.all_simple_paths(G, 'A', 'C'))  # [['A', 'B', 'C']]
```

**lift-sys already uses NetworkX** for call graphs → Easy integration!

---

## 4. Performance Characteristics

### 4.1 Observed Performance (from testing)

**Fitting (1000 samples, 3-node graph)**:
- Time: ~0.01 seconds
- Memory: Negligible (< 50MB)

**Intervention Generation (100 samples)**:
- Time: < 0.001 seconds
- Memory: Minimal

**Scalability**:
- Node count: Tested up to ~50 nodes in examples, should handle 100+
- Sample count: Efficiently handles 1000s-10000s
- Mechanism complexity: Linear models very fast, nonlinear models slower

### 4.2 Expected Performance for lift-sys

**Reverse Mode - 1000 file codebase**:
- Graph construction: O(files × avg_dependencies) = 1000 × 5 = 5000 edges
- Fitting: Estimated 1-5 seconds (parallel fitting possible)
- Queries: < 100ms per intervention

**Bottlenecks**:
- Data collection (execution traces): Can be slow
- Complex nonlinear mechanisms: May require sampling
- Very large graphs (10K+ nodes): NetworkX operations may slow

**Mitigation**:
- Start with subset of critical files
- Use linear approximations where possible
- Cache fitted models
- Parallelize fitting across independent sub-graphs

---

## 5. Integration Points with lift-sys

### 5.1 Reverse Mode Enhancement (PRIMARY)

**Current Reverse Mode** (`lift_sys/reverse_mode/`):
- AST extraction
- Call graph construction
- CodeQL security analysis
- Static dependency analysis

**DoWhy Addition**:
- Convert call graph → Causal DAG
- Fit causal mechanisms from execution traces
- Answer queries:
  - "What functions are affected if I modify X?"
  - "What's the root cause of this output?"
  - "What would output be if I change this parameter?"

**Integration Point**: `Lifter.lift_all()`
```python
class Lifter:
    def lift_all(self) -> list[IR]:
        # Current: AST + call graph
        # Add: Causal graph + fitted SCM

        causal_graph = self._build_causal_graph()  # NEW
        scm = self._fit_scm(causal_graph, traces)  # NEW

        # Store in IR metadata
        ir.metadata['causal_model'] = scm
```

### 5.2 Test Generation

**Current**: Coverage-based test generation

**DoWhy Addition**:
- Identify critical causal paths in IR
- Generate tests covering high-impact edges
- Prioritize tests by causal importance

**Integration Point**: `lift_sys/validation/`
```python
def generate_causal_tests(ir: IR, scm: StructuralCausalModel):
    # Find critical causal paths
    critical_paths = identify_critical_paths(scm)

    # Generate tests for each path
    tests = []
    for path in critical_paths:
        test = generate_path_test(path, scm)
        tests.append(test)

    return tests
```

### 5.3 Constraint Validation

**Use Case**: Verify IR transformations preserve causal properties

**Example**:
```python
def validate_transformation(ir_before: IR, ir_after: IR):
    scm_before = fit_scm(ir_before)
    scm_after = fit_scm(ir_after)

    # Check: Does transformation preserve causal effects?
    for intervention in test_interventions:
        effect_before = scm_before.intervene(intervention)
        effect_after = scm_after.intervene(intervention)

        if not effects_equivalent(effect_before, effect_after):
            raise ValidationError("Transformation changes behavior!")
```

**Integration Point**: `lift_sys/validation/constraint_validator.py`

### 5.4 Semantic IR Enhancement

**Connection to Semantic IR roadmap**:
- Causal relationships are a form of semantic metadata
- Add to `SemanticMetadata.relationships`

**Schema Addition**:
```python
class CausalRelationship(BaseModel):
    source: str
    target: str
    mechanism_type: str  # "linear", "nonlinear", "stochastic"
    strength: float  # causal effect size
    confidence: float  # 0-1
```

**Integration Point**: `lift_sys/ir/semantic_models.py` (future)

### 5.5 Forward Mode Enhancement (Lower Priority)

**Use Case**: Generate code that preserves causal structure

**Example**: User specifies:
- "Create function that transforms X → Y"
- DoWhy validates: Does generated code preserve causal relationship?

**Integration Point**: Code generation validation

## 6. Code Examples

### 6.1 Basic GCM Creation

```python
import networkx as nx
import pandas as pd
from dowhy import gcm

# Define causal structure
graph = nx.DiGraph([('input', 'validation'), ('validation', 'output')])

# Create model
scm = gcm.StructuralCausalModel(graph)

# Sample data (e.g., from execution traces)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'input': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'validation': [True, True, False, True, True],
    'output': [10, 20, 0, 40, 50]
})

# Fit mechanisms
gcm.auto.assign_causal_mechanisms(scm, data)
gcm.fit(scm, data)

# Query: What if all inputs were valid?
intervention = gcm.interventional_samples(
    scm,
    {'validation': lambda v: True},
    num_samples_to_draw=100
)
print(f"Expected output with valid inputs: {intervention['output'].mean()}")
```

### 6.2 Code Dependency Analysis

```python
# Model a function's causal structure
code_graph = nx.DiGraph([
    ('arg1', 'validate_args'),
    ('arg2', 'validate_args'),
    ('config', 'load_config'),
    ('validate_args', 'process'),
    ('load_config', 'process'),
    ('process', 'return_value')
])

scm = gcm.StructuralCausalModel(code_graph)

# Fit from execution traces
# (traces = DataFrame with columns matching nodes)
gcm.auto.assign_causal_mechanisms(scm, execution_traces)
gcm.fit(scm, execution_traces)

# Query: What if arg1 was always positive?
pos_arg_samples = gcm.interventional_samples(
    scm,
    {'arg1': lambda x: abs(x)},
    num_samples_to_draw=500
)

# Analyze impact on return_value distribution
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pos_arg_samples['return_value'].hist()
plt.title("Return value distribution with positive arg1")
```

### 6.3 Refactoring Impact Analysis

```python
# Before refactoring
scm_before = gcm.StructuralCausalModel(graph_before)
gcm.fit(scm_before, traces_before)

# After refactoring
scm_after = gcm.StructuralCausalModel(graph_after)
gcm.fit(scm_after, traces_after)

# Compare causal effects
test_interventions = [
    {'input': lambda x: 0},
    {'input': lambda x: 100},
    {'input': lambda x: -50}
]

for interv in test_interventions:
    output_before = gcm.interventional_samples(scm_before, interv, 1000)
    output_after = gcm.interventional_samples(scm_after, interv, 1000)

    # Statistical test: Are distributions equivalent?
    from scipy.stats import ks_2samp
    stat, pval = ks_2samp(
        output_before['result'],
        output_after['result']
    )

    if pval < 0.05:
        print(f"⚠️ Refactoring changes behavior for {interv}")
    else:
        print(f"✓ Behavior preserved for {interv}")
```

## 7. Installation & Setup

### 7.1 Python Version Requirement

**DoWhy**: Supports Python 3.8-3.12
**lift-sys**: Currently uses Python 3.13

**Issue**: DoWhy dependency `cvxpy` fails to build on Python 3.13 (NumPy API compatibility)

**Solution**: Use `uv` to manage Python versions

### 7.2 Installation Steps

```bash
# 1. Install Python 3.11 (if not already available)
uv python install 3.11

# 2. Create separate venv for DoWhy
uv venv --python 3.11 .venv-dowhy

# 3. Install DoWhy and dependencies
uv pip install --python .venv-dowhy/bin/python dowhy networkx pandas numpy

# 4. Test installation
.venv-dowhy/bin/python -c "import dowhy; print(dowhy.__version__)"
# Output: 0.13
```

### 7.3 lift-sys Integration Strategy

**Option A: Separate Process** (Recommended initially)
- Run DoWhy analysis in separate Python 3.11 process
- Communicate via JSON/IPC
- Pros: No version conflicts, isolated dependencies
- Cons: Process overhead (~100ms startup)

**Option B: Conditional Import**
- Only import DoWhy when needed
- Fail gracefully if unavailable
- Pros: Simple fallback
- Cons: Some features unavailable on Python 3.13

**Option C: Wait for cvxpy fix**
- Track: https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/issues
- Expected: 2025 Q4 (based on historical release cadence)
- Pros: Clean integration
- Cons: Delays integration

**Recommendation**: **Option A** - Use separate process initially, migrate to Option C when cvxpy supports Python 3.13

### 7.4 Dependency Management

**Add to `pyproject.toml`** (optional dependency):
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
causal = [
    "dowhy>=0.13",
    "networkx>=3.0"
]
```

**Installation**:
```bash
# Users who want causal features
uv pip install --python 3.11 lift-sys[causal]
```
