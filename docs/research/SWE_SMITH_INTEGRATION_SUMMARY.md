# SWE-smith Integration Plan - Implementation Summary

**Created**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Plan Complete and Tracked in Beads
**Goal**: Break through 80-90% success plateau → achieve 95%+ using SWE-smith methodologies

## What Was Created

### 1. Analysis Document
**File**: `SWE_SMITH_EVALUATION.md`
**Size**: ~15,000 words

Comprehensive evaluation of how SWE-smith's methodologies apply to lift-sys:
- What SWE-smith is and what it achieved (+32% improvement)
- Detailed applicability analysis for each methodology
- Implementation recommendations (Tier 1-3 priorities)
- Cost-benefit analysis ($300-700, 7-9 weeks)
- Risk assessment and mitigations

**Key Finding**: Adopt methodologies, not infrastructure - SWE-smith's value is in synthetic data generation and fine-tuning approach, which can be adapted to lift-sys's function-level task domain.

### 2. Detailed Implementation Plan
**File**: `SWE_SMITH_INTEGRATION_BEADS.md`
**Size**: ~8,000 words

Complete phase-by-phase plan with:
- 7 major phases, 23 detailed tasks
- Architecture for each component
- Code examples and implementation notes
- Dependencies and integration points
- Timeline and resource estimates

### 3. Beads Task Tracking
**Issues**: lift-sys-202 through lift-sys-224 (23 tasks)

**When**: End of Week 7
**Criteria**: 95%+ success rate on expanded test suite (300+ tests)
**Decision Point**: If <90%, analyze and iterate; if 90-95%, acceptable; if 95%+, success!

## Integration with Existing lift-sys Architecture

### What's Preserved

✅ **IR Design** - Still the core specification language
✅ **Modal Infrastructure** - Extended for training workloads
✅ **XGrammar Constraints** - Syntactic guarantees still apply
✅ **Reverse Mode** - Enhanced for batch processing
✅ **Validation** - Shared between training and inference
✅ **Forward Mode** - Improved through better model

### What's New

🆕 **GitHub Scraper** - Extract training data from repos
🆕 **Batch Lifter** - Parallel reverse mode processing
🆕 **Prompt Synthesizer** - Generate NL prompts from code
🆕 **Execution Validator** - SWE-smith-style filtering
🆕 **LoRA Training** - Fine-tune on Modal
🆕 **Model Registry** - Track versions and performance
🆕 **A/B Testing** - Compare models in production
🆕 **Continuous Pipeline** - Automated data collection & retraining

### Synergies

**Reverse Mode → Training Data**: Reverse mode becomes the engine for extracting IRs from GitHub code, creating training data at scale.

**Validation → Quality Filter**: Existing assertion checking and AST validation used to filter training examples (only keep working ones).

**Modal → Training Platform**: Existing Modal deployment extended to handle LoRA fine-tuning on A100/H100 GPUs.

**XGrammar + Fine-Tuned Model**: Syntactic constraints + semantic understanding = higher quality output.

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

**Risk**: Reverse mode can't extract quality IRs from GitHub code
**Impact**: Low-quality training data → poor fine-tuned model
**Mitigation**:
- Small-scale pilot (100 examples) before full dataset generation
- Can fall back to manual curation (300-500 examples like original plan)
- Use quality scoring to filter top examples

**Risk**: Fine-tuning doesn't improve performance
**Impact**: 2-3 weeks + $200-500 wasted
**Mitigation**:
- Validate on small dataset first (500 examples)
- SWE-smith precedent shows it works (+32%)
- LoRA is low-cost and reversible

**Risk**: Can't hit 95% target (stuck at 90%)
**Impact**: Significant effort for marginal gain
**Mitigation**:
- 90% is still excellent (current 80-90%)
- Phase 6 includes iteration planning
- Can apply learnings to next round

### Medium-Risk Items

- GitHub API rate limits → Use multiple tokens, spread over time
- Training costs exceed budget → Start smaller, scale if promising
- Time overruns → Phased approach allows stopping after Phase 3

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. ✅ Review this summary and the detailed plan
2. ✅ Confirm approach aligns with goals
3. ⏭️ **Decision Point**: Approve to begin implementation?

### If Approved (Week 1)
1. Start with lift-sys-202: Design GitHub Data Collection Architecture
2. Small-scale pilot (100 functions from 5 repos)
3. Validate reverse mode quality
4. Decision: full implementation or fall back to manual curation

### Week 2-7
Follow the phased plan, track progress in beads, adjust as needed.

### Week 7 Decision Point
Based on comprehensive evaluation (lift-sys-219):
- **If 95%+**: Success! Document and deploy

## Conclusion

This plan integrates **SWE-smith's proven methodologies** (synthetic data generation, execution-based filtering, model fine-tuning) with **lift-sys's existing strengths** (formal IR, Modal infrastructure, XGrammar constraints, validation) to break through the 80-90% success plateau.

**Key Innovation**: Using lift-sys's reverse mode as a training data generation engine, extracting (prompt, IR, code) triples from real GitHub repositories at scale, then fine-tuning Qwen3-30B-FP8 to specialize for lift-sys's domain.

**Expected Result**: 95%+ success rate through specialized model training on 5,000-10,000 real-world validated examples.

**Ready to Begin**: All 23 tasks tracked in beads, dependencies mapped, resources estimated.
