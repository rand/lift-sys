# Meta-Framework Reification Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅
**Version**: 1.0

---

## What Was Created

The meta-framework for **design by typed holes** has been fully reified into:
- ✅ **4 Planning Documents**
- ✅ **1 Tracking Script** (with 3 more TODO)
- ✅ **7 Phase Beads**

---

## Documentation Created

### 1. META_FRAMEWORK_DESIGN_BY_HOLES.md
**Path**: `docs/planning/META_FRAMEWORK_DESIGN_BY_HOLES.md`

**Purpose**: Core meta-framework document describing the hole-driven development process

**Key Sections**:
- Proposal viewed as an IR
- Hole-driven development process
- Constraint propagation rules
- Iterative refinement timeline (7 phases)
- Design completeness criteria
- Usage guide for tools

**How to Use**:
- **Read first** to understand the meta-framework
- Reference when planning each phase
- Update as holes are resolved

---

### 2. HOLE_INVENTORY.md
**Path**: `docs/planning/HOLE_INVENTORY.md`

**Purpose**: Complete catalog of all 19 typed holes with dependencies

**Contents**:
- **19 holes** (H1-H19) with full specifications
- Type classifications (Implementation, Interface, Specification, Constraint, Validation)
- Dependency graph (blocks/blocked_by relationships)
- Status tracking (Pending, Ready, In Progress, Resolved, Blocked)
- Critical path identified

**How to Use**:
- **Reference** when working on any hole
- **Update** when a hole is resolved
- **Check dependencies** before starting work

**Current Status**:
- Total: 19 holes
- Ready: 3 (H6, H9, H14)
- Blocked: 16
- Resolved: 0

---

### 3. CONSTRAINT_PROPAGATION_LOG.md
**Path**: `docs/planning/CONSTRAINT_PROPAGATION_LOG.md`

**Purpose**: Living log of constraint propagation events

**Contents**:
- Event template for each hole resolution
- Propagation rules (Interface → Type, Implementation → Performance, etc.)
- Example propagation chains
- Conflict detection guidance

**How to Use**:
- **Add entry** after resolving each hole
- **Document** which constraints propagated where
- **Track** solution space reduction
- **Detect** conflicts early

---

### 4. PHASE_GATES_VALIDATION.md
**Path**: `docs/planning/PHASE_GATES_VALIDATION.md`

**Purpose**: Validation criteria for each phase gate

**Contents**:
- **7 gates** (one per phase)
- Functional, performance, quality, and documentation criteria
- Pass/fail tracking
- Gate execution process

**How to Use**:
- **Review** before starting each phase
- **Track progress** against criteria during phase
- **Validate** at end of phase
- **Only proceed** if gate passes

---

## Scripts Created

### track_holes.py
**Path**: `scripts/planning/track_holes.py`
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Commands**:
```bash
# List holes
python scripts/planning/track_holes.py list [--status STATUS] [--phase PHASE]

# Show hole details
python scripts/planning/track_holes.py show HOLE_ID

# Find ready holes
python scripts/planning/track_holes.py ready [--phase PHASE]

# Mark hole resolved
python scripts/planning/track_holes.py resolve HOLE_ID --resolution PATH

# Phase status
python scripts/planning/track_holes.py phase-status PHASE

# Visualize dependencies
python scripts/planning/track_holes.py visualize [--output PATH]
```

**Examples**:
```bash
# What's ready to work on?
python scripts/planning/track_holes.py ready --phase 1
# Output: H6: NodeSignatureInterface, H9: ValidationHooks, H14: ResourceLimits

# Show details for H6
python scripts/planning/track_holes.py show H6

# Mark H6 as resolved
python scripts/planning/track_holes.py resolve H6 --resolution lift_sys/dspy_signatures/node_interface.py

# Check phase 1 status
python scripts/planning/track_holes.py phase-status 1

# Generate dependency graph
python scripts/planning/track_holes.py visualize --output docs/planning/deps.dot
dot -Tpng docs/planning/deps.dot -o docs/planning/dependency_graph.png
```

### TODO Scripts
The following scripts are referenced but not yet implemented:
- `validate_resolution.py` - Test if resolution satisfies constraints
- `propagate_constraints.py` - Compute constraint propagation
- `check_completeness.py` - Verify design completeness

---

## Beads Created

### Phase Beads
Created 7 phase beads tracking meta-framework execution:

1. **Phase 1**: Foundation Holes - Interface Completeness
   - Holes: H6, H9, H14
   - Week 1

2. **Phase 2**: Execution Holes - Provider Integration
   - Holes: H1, H2, H11
   - Week 2

3. **Phase 3**: Optimization Holes - Metrics and API
   - Holes: H10, H8, H12
   - Week 3

4. **Phase 4**: Parallelization Holes - Concurrent Execution
   - Holes: H4, H16, H18
   - Week 4

5. **Phase 5**: Caching and Performance - Optimization
   - Holes: H3, H7
   - Week 5

6. **Phase 6**: Migration and Validation - Production Readiness
   - Holes: H15, H13, H19
   - Week 6

7. **Phase 7**: Final Validation - Statistical Confirmation
   - Holes: H17, H5
   - Week 7

**Check beads**:
```bash
bd list --labels phase
```

## How to Use the Reified System

### Week-by-Week Workflow

#### Start of Week N

1. **Check phase bead**:
   ```bash
   bd show <phase-bead-id>
   ```

2. **Find ready holes**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/planning/track_holes.py ready --phase N
   ```

3. **Pick a hole** (start with critical path):
   ```bash
   python scripts/planning/track_holes.py show H6
   ```

4. **Review gate criteria**:
   - Read relevant section in `PHASE_GATES_VALIDATION.md`

#### During Week N

1. **Work on hole** - Implement resolution

2. **Track progress** - Update phase bead

3. **Test resolution** - Run validation (TODO: validate_resolution.py)

4. **Document decisions** - Why this approach?

#### End of Week N

1. **Mark hole resolved**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/planning/track_holes.py resolve H6 --resolution lift_sys/dspy_signatures/node_interface.py
   ```

2. **Document propagation** in `CONSTRAINT_PROPAGATION_LOG.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## Event 1: 2025-10-20
   **Hole Resolved**: H6 - NodeSignatureInterface
   **Resolution**: BaseNode with async run() -> NextNode | End

   ### Constraints Propagated
   #### To H1: ProviderAdapter
   **New Constraint**: Must support async DSPy calls
   ...
   ```

3. **Update hole inventory** - Mark H6 as RESOLVED

4. **Validate gate**:
   - Check all criteria in `PHASE_GATES_VALIDATION.md`
   - Update gate status (PASS/FAIL)

5. **Update phase bead**:
   ```bash
   bd update <phase-bead-id> --status in_progress  # or closed if done
   ```

#### Between Weeks

1. **Check newly ready holes**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/planning/track_holes.py ready
   # Shows holes that were unblocked by last week's work
   ```

2. **Review constraint log** - What changed?

3. **Plan next week** - Pick holes for next phase

---

## Critical Path

The **critical path** through the holes (must resolve in order):

```
H6 → H1 → H10 → H17
(NodeSignatureInterface → ProviderAdapter → OptimizationMetrics → OptimizationValidation)
```

**Timeline**: Weeks 1, 2, 3, 7

**Why Critical**: These holes block multiple other holes and are on the longest dependency chain.
